## BAUR (Boxing and Unboxing of Records)

In boxing and unboxing of records, we use a DEA problem to maximise returns from given input of data. The Decision Making Units (DMUs) play an important role. The Established Golden Records of Data are used to perform statistical tests in order to understand the metadata characteristics and data lineage of the underlying source.

### Transform Input

The Input Values are transformed and combined with Statistical Distributions in order to produce a simulated output. 

The transformation of input and output are also used within Serialization of the DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) Objective.

### Serialize DEA

DEA is a constrained optimization problem which maximises the efficiency of output. Serialization must be in place in order to obtain the fine tuned model and feed that to the resulting execution component.
