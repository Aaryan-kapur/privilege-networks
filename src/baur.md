## BAUR (Boxing and Unboxing of Records)

In boxing and unboxing of records, we use a DEA problem to maximise returns from given input of data. The Decision Making Units (DMUs) play an important role. The Established Golden Records of Data are used to perform statistical tests in order to understand the metadata characteristics and data lineage of the underlying source.
