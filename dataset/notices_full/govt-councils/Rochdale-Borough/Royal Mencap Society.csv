The accommodation is being built by Hampshire County Council (The Council) and consists of 2 semi-detached bungalows each with 3 bedrooms. The scheme will support service users to manage and maintain their tenancies and to access their local community and its resources.

The new system is:
•	replacing statements of SEN and learning disability assessments with Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans - setting out in one place all the support families will receive;
•	requiring councils to publish a 'local offer' showing the support available in the area to all children and young people who have disabilities or SEN;
•	requiring better co-operation between councils and health services to make sure services for children and young people with SEN and disabilities are jointly planned and commissioned;
•	giving parents and young people with EHC plans the offer of a personal budget;
•	introducing mediation for disputes; and 
•	introducing a legal right for children and young people with an EHC plan to express a preference for state academies, free schools and further education colleges.

On 26 January 2016, the Children's Minister Edward Timpson, announced a package of additional support for implementation of the SEND reforms in England during 2016-17.  This included: 
o	£35.8 million in implementation funding for local authorities in 2016 to 2017, recognising the additional duties placed on them as a result of the transition to EHC plans 
o	£27.3 million for the Family Fund Trust to support low income families with disabled children 
o	£15 million to fund the independent supporters programme, helping to support families and young people to navigate the system, and creating positive experiences for them 
o	£2.3 million for Parent Carer Forums, which bring parents together to provide invaluable support and advice for families
To complement this programme of delivery support, the Government is now seeking applications for a new contract in 2017-18 to improve access to employment for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).  
Some of the key requirements for the contract are provided at Annex A.  Further information is contained within the Invitation to Tender documentation.  To request a copy of the documentation, please e mail the contracts mailbox at: Contracts2017-18.SEND@education.gov.uk, quoting the contract title and reference number.

Due to the estimated discharges in the next 12 months within the Pan-Lancashire area, a Flexible Agreement has been developed. This is intended to be an interim agreement and will initially be in place for one year with the option to extend for up to a further three years if required.  This is to allow the time to develop further commissioning options for Transforming Care whilst allowing us to have an initial agreement in operation as early as October 2016, to allow Transforming Care placements to be commissioned with suitably selected providers via this Flexible Agreement.
Social value has been considered throughout the development of the service specification and is part of the evaluation methodology.
Please note that the original RFQ in relation to this tender has been amended due to a revision to the selection criteria in relation to CQC ratings.

LCC requires a Provider to be registered with CQC for the regulated activity of Personal Care by the tender deadline of the 12th August 2016 however if a Provider nominates an office that is currently unrated as it has not yet been inspected by CQC then your Submission will not be disregarded on that basis, however at the point when the office has its first inspection you must inform the lead officer immediately and your nominated office must meet the requirements of either outstanding, good or requires improvement (latter with robust justification). Prior to contract award where the status of your nominated office does not meet the requirements for the Flexible Agreement your Submission will be disregarded. Following contract award if any provider is given an overall rating of requires improvement or inadequate for the nominated office the Contracting Body reserves the right to suspend/terminate the agreement depending on its own judgement.  

The RFQ on the e-tendering system has been amended to reflect this along with all the tender documents. The tender deadline will be extended to the 12/08/16 to allow providers sufficient time to consider submitting a bid having taken into account the revised criteria.",,,"North West","85000000 ","Joanne Sherborne",joanne.sherborne@lancashire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Christ Church Precinct","County Hall",Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"01772 531427",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41137&e=e ","Please Note:  Value of Contract

> The ISF Provider is accountable to the individual (as well as to the Council). 

> The ISF Provider commits to spend the money only on the individual's service and the management and support necessary to provide that service 

An ISF Provider can deliver some or all of the services required to meet the individual's assessed care and support needs and outcomes. Where an organisation does not deliver all the services, they can work with the individual to outsource to another organisation or support them to purchase equipment, employ Personal Assistants, or arrange other types of support.

North East Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group (NELCCG) hereby invites suitable providers to become approved onto a new framework, to provide supported living and housing related support to vulnerable adults (people with learning/physical disability/autism/mental health).  The framework will run for a 4 year period from April 2019.

Providers will be expected to deliver good quality outcomes to people living in both single occupancy and group dwellings (and to demonstrate achieved outcomes), and to increase and promote independent living as stated within the enclosed specification.  

It is intended that the current framework providers who meet the requirements of the new framework will continue to deliver their current provision for both Supported Living and Housing Related Support.

For any new developments that are commissioned during the framework period, providers approved onto the framework will be approached and asked to respond and will be selected in the form of a ""mini tender"".  The ""mini tender"" will be designed according to the requirements.

TUPE is likely to apply should any current providers not meet the required standards or choose not to bid.

"TD1228 - DN259638 (2)",Contract,"Derby City Council",Awarded,2018-01-05T14:38:28Z,"Provision of Younger Adults Domiciliary Care Services Framework","In line with good practice and national directives, Local Authorities aim to reduce the demand for institutional care by increasing options for community support by commissioning or providing services which promote and support independence.  

Derby City Council is therefore tendering for a Younger Adults Domiciliary Care Services framework for people with complex needs to be delivered in their own homes from November 2017 This will replace an existing Dynamic Purchasing Service Agreement.

The Framework will provide support for younger adults with complex needs, those with a learning disability and / or autism, and with mental health difficulties.  Many will have, at times, behaviours that are considered to be ""challenging"", and providers will be required to demonstrate how they can minimise its impact by developing positive work with individuals.

The Council wishes to commission services that improve Customers' wellbeing or quality of life where the quality of the service is measured by the improvement in quality of life outcomes.  An enablement approach lies at the heart of the services we wish to procure for Domiciliary Care and providers will be assessed for their success in this area.

This outcomes based approach will necessitate a change in the relationship between Customers, Providers and Commissioners as it requires a greater focus upon person-centred working and the adoption of outcomes based purchasing, provision and monitoring of services.

Outcome based service provision requires the following:

•	Each Customer will have their personal Customer Outcomes which are to be met by the service agreed.  The views of their carer or representative if appropriate will be taken into consideration and will form part of this Agreement.
•	The Authority will then specify the Customer Outcomes to be met by The Service Provider
•	The Service Provider, in consultation with social care leads, will agree with each Customer how and when they will be supported to achieve their Outcomes.

Please note suppliers wishing to express interest and obtain the documentation must do so by 17:00 on 24th September 2017. It is recommended that you express interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit a bid. 

The deadline for returns is 10:00 on 25th September 2017. 

Please visit the Council's e-tendering system at www.eastmidstenders.org, where you can express interest and obtain the documents.
