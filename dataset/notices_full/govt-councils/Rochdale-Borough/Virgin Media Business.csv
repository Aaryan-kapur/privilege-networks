(Wide Area Network) and LAN (Local Area Network) contracts with VMB (Virgin 
Media Business). The WAN contract has already been extended to the maximum 
term permitted.  NYP is required to have a compliant network under the PSN-P 
legislation a further tender is required to ensure that a compliant solution 
remains in place.
Furthermore, NYP are moving to a new HQ in Northallerton in 2017 and will 
require network connection at Alverton Court in March 2017. It is intended that 
this would be the first phase of work under a new contract. NYP's Wi-Fi 
maintenance contract expires in February 2017 and this scope of work will be 
included in this tender. 
Being a geographically large and rural county there are significant challenges in 
ensuring that quality network connectivity is maintained on a 24/7/365 basis. 
The scope of the proposed contract will include a scalable, highly available and 
affordable solution. All NYP sites will be included in the scope with the project 
linking into the NYP Estates Strategy and the contract will allow for rationalisation  
of buildings and locations throughout the contract term.
Potential suppliers will be required to demonstrate that they can provide a 
suitable and affordable solution. It is expected that a blend of MPLS 
(Multiprotocol Label Switching) cloud service options will be proposed to help 
reduce annual revenue costs. 
Due to the increased level of services running from NYP's two data centres an 
increased bandwidth option is required. This is will be an increase above current 
bandwidth levels to ensure availably and disaster recovery is maintained for 
current and future systems.
During the transition from the current network to a new solution, some disruption 
will be encountered, however the proposed solution will ensure that this will be 
removed or reduced where possible.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","72710000 72720000 ","Gerald Foster",gerald.foster@southyorks.pnn.police.uk,"North Yorkshire Police, Newby Wiske HQ.","Newby Wiske",Northallerton,"DL7 9HA",ENG,01609643499,,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=16562&B=BLUELIGHT https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/36335 ",,13/09/2016,12/09/2021,19/08/2016,NO,,No,No,No,Services,4200000,4500000,12/01/2017,4200000,"[Virgin Media Business|Media House, Bartley Way, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire RG27 9UP|||No|No]","David Colston",13/09/2016,12/09/2021,"Other ",

Public Services Network (PSN) for use by or on behalf of the UK public sector bodies listed at VI.3 of the Contract Notice (and any future successors to these organisations).

The listed public sector bodies have a need for the provision of connectivity, telecommunications and other services, including PSN compliant services and non PSN compliant services, to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information.

This Framework Agreement addresses this need by facilitating the provision of innovative connectivity and telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services available under the Framework Agreement include data access services; local connectivity services; traditional telephony services; inbound telephony services; IP-telephony solutions; mobile, voice and data services; paging services; video conferencing; audio conferencing; and integrated communications services. Including, but not limited to, networks, Wi-Fi, gateways & related services; voice lines and minute bundles; mobile services including voice and data, pager services; email services; internet service provision, content filtering services and intruder detection systems; communication services including video and audio conferencing services, and unified communications; call centre services; and associated supporting services including but not limited to security, information assurance, design/build/operate consultancy, acquisition, technology audit and site surveys; and other services as described in the Contract Notice (provided as an attachment); the Framework Agreement; the Call Off Terms; and the Call Off Order Form .

The Framework Agreement is suitable for the provision of services that are PSN compliant; and also for the provision of services at lower security levels; or that do not require PSN compliance.

The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the Framework Agreement may also be used by UK contracting authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this Procurement may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). No weight was attached to whether or not an economic operator was an SME when assessing the most economically advantageous tender.

The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of two (2) years with the option to extend by two further terms of up to one (1) year each. 

Electronic auctions may be employed by Contracting Bodies using the Framework Agreement.
