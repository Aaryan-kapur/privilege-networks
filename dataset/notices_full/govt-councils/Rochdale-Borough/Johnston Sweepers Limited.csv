2490/JS,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD",Awarded,2020-05-26T09:16:07Z,"2490/JS - Compact Road Sweeper","The University of Sheffield campus is considered to be a city centre campus and extends to the North and South areas of the city centre and neighbouring residential suburbs.

The Estates & Facilities Management Department (EFM) support the University in the provision, maintenance and management of the built environment and intersecting public realm spaces. This environment is managed to the highest standards of hygiene, safety & customer appeal.

Specifically, EFM work to develop and maintain the University outdoor space to the highest standard through its Landscape and Campus services teams. This includes use of mechanical sweeper equipment to maintain hygiene standards across open space, precinct & public realm areas

In May 2015 the University of Sheffield purchased a compact road sweeper plus a 5 year maintenance contract. The existing five year maintenance contract is based on the existing sweeper recording no more than 1,560 hours (averaging 30 hours per week) for each year of the contract (7,800 miles in total).

The University of Sheffield is looking to purchase a second compact road sweeper (plus a 5 year maintenance contract). The new sweeper will be deployed alongside the existing sweeper on the University's central campus and will be used for approximately 30 hours per week. There may be a slight reduction in usage outside of term time (mid-June to mid-September each year).
The purpose of this tender is to set out a specification for the following requirements:-
 
•	The purchase of one compact sweeper machine;
•	A comprehensive monthly maintenance and servicing contract (for a period of 5 years)

This sweeper will operate on a five-day week, running for up to 30 hours per week (up to 1,560 hours per annum).

The sweeper will be capable of operating in areas of high foot fall across precinct and highway spaces namely around the S10 2TN postcode.

The sweeper will operate on tarmac, bloc paved and granite setts surfaces without damaging jointing materials or drain installations.

The sweeper will be designed to remove discarded litter and leaves. It will operate in all weathers and light conditions except when temperatures fall below 4 degrees C. 

The sweeper will be equipped with a remote suction hose to enable removal of debris from areas inaccessible by the sweeper and will have a jet wash facility (in the region of 10-12L per minute at 100 bar) to allow for wash off cleaning activities.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","34144431 34921100 ","Jamie Shaw",jamie.shaw@sheffield.ac.uk,"Western Bank",,SHEFFIELD,S102TN,England,"0114 2221516",,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield.
