tender_208517/833614,Contract,"West Midlands Combined Authority",Awarded,2020-04-15T11:46:54Z,"PRISM 5 Continuation Services Framework","In the West Midlands metropolitan area there are two variable-demand strategic transport models: PRISM (Policy Responsive Integrated Strategic Model) and CASM (Coventry Area Strategic Model). Highways England has a Midlands Regional Traffic Model [MRTM] that covers the whole West Midlands Conurbation and a wider area: this is not a model to which WMCA has presumed access rights but MRTM data was used in the building of PRISM 5. There are a small number of sub-conurbation highway network models in Saturn and numerous micro-simulation tools covering local areas; these models being owned by WMCA and the Constituent Authorities and operated by them or their modelling services suppliers. 
 Our most substantial and only conurbation-wide model is PRISM. This was built as a large strategic model intended to gain insight into strategic issues to inform policy and planning, but which has primarily been used to support business case development for large public transport schemes and the less frequent refreshes of local planning policy. It has evolved to do this well in the sense that business cases have been successfully produced and defended and local plans evidenced using the model have withstood planning inquiry examination and challenge. 
 The client group, comprising TfWM and the 7 Local Authorities, are seeking to appoint consultants for transport modelling services in the West Midlands. The appointed suppliers will apply, maintain and enhance PRISM 5 on behalf of the client group. A separate procurement activity is taking place in parallel to this tender to seek suppliers to support TfWM in the creation of our future modelling capability that will offer complementary modelling capabilities, some of which could supersede parts of the modelling functions offered by PRISM. However, we expect to continue using PRISM for the whole of this services framework period.",,,"West Midlands","71311200 ","West Midlands Combined Authority",procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,,,,,01/04/2020,29/03/2024,29/11/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,4750000,,03/02/2020,4750000,"[Jacobs UK Ltd|7th Floor, 2 Colmore Square, 38 Colmore Circus Queensway, Birmingham, West Midlands, B4 6BN|COMPANIES_HOUSE|2594504|No|No][Mott MacDonald Ltd|35 Newhall Street, Birmingham, West Midlands, B3 3PU|COMPANIES_HOUSE|1243967|No|No][SWECO UK Ltd|Grove House, Mansion Gate Drive, Leeds, West Yorkshire|COMPANIES_HOUSE|02888385|No|No][SYSTRA Ltd|Fifth Floor, Lancaster House, Newhall Street, Birmingham, West Midlands, B3 1NQ|COMPANIES_HOUSE|338212|No|No][WSP UK Ltd|One Queens Drive, Birmingham, West Midlands, B5 4PJ|COMPANIES_HOUSE|1383511|No|No]","Geoff Smith",01/04/2020,29/03/2024,"OpenOJEU ",

It is a high level review intended to identify potential current and future opportunities. It is not expected to provide detailed cost information; rather, a high level assessment of potential; estimated timescales to implementation; and an indication of costs and benefits with the consideration given to how they may be best funded for the wider public good. 
We can facilitate contacts with the appropriate water resources, flood risk management and navigation leads at the Environment Agency and at Canals and Rivers Trust, but the review of opportunities does not need to be constrained to these parties only; we welcome further insights from consultants with relevant expertise.Identify options considered but not included in the water companies' final WRMPs, which could have wider regional or national benefit.Review unconstrained options lists from relevant WRMPs.Identify any options with benefit of or above 20 Ml/d which did not make it to companies' preferred plans. Review and categorise the reasons for elimination of each scheme; and consider whether a different decision would have been made if the scheme was considered in the regional/national/multi-user interest instead of a single company's.Identify and review opportunities for increasing and sharing resources that might exist outside the public water supply in England and Wales. (Note: for completeness, this task will be supported by the Environment Agency who has committed to provide a high level assessment on water available for further abstraction in England. We'd expect the consultants to form a high level view - informed by discussion with NRW - of water that may be available for abstraction and transfer from Wales).Identify potential partners from sectors outside of public water supply whose assets could have potential to increase water availability (such as - but not limited to - owners of navigation and flood risk management assets). Gather the necessary information on potential options for supply and transfers, and make a high level assessment of feasibility of these options.
This task is envisaged to focus on scoping future opportunities for multi-functional use of flood risk and navigation assets; however, we are also interested in an informed view on any opportunities/options for water resources that might exist currently
Present findings and recommendations in the draft report, to be shared with the steering group and other interested stakeholders including regional water resource groups and partners identified during the review. The report should include a high level assessment of potential for water resources; estimated timescales to implementation; a high level indication of costs and benefits; and a consideration of potential sources of funding outside of the public water sector.Produce final report and hold a dissemination workshop.

This is because we will be starting our preparation for Phase IV of EU ETS, involving a large scale data collection exercise, where we will collect a range of data required to determine operators' free allocations of allowances. We would expect this activity to last for approximately one year. At the same time, we will be continuing our front line business as usual activities to deliver our statutory duties, however there are some unknowns about the future
implementation of the regime because of EU Exit. Therefore, we require the flexibility of having additional
resource to deliver our business as usual activities, and / or the data collection exercise, without increasing our overall headcount. Therefore, we are seeking to source up to four full time equivalents (FTE) to provide the additional resource.

We will let this contract to a single contractor or multiple contractors proposing candidates with the necessary experience, skills and capacity to successfully occupy a maximum of four FTEs. Suppliers bidding for this requirement may propose one or more candidates in their submissions.

PROC.01.0494,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2016-09-05T15:47:12Z,"Accounting Separation Plan and Implementation Advice","Key Tasks
This requirement will be wholly or mostly internal to Ofwat. Although it is possible that you might have some meetings and/or visits to water companies, we do not expect this to be significant.

•	Meeting with the Director of Accounting and understanding the requirements
•	Meeting/ interviewing other regulatory accountants within Ofwat to understand the range of views, issues and experience to draw upon
•	Meeting/ interviewing the key economics/ policy leads for the relevant work-streams within the Water 2020 programme. This will be a key activity, with the objective of understanding the economic/ regulatory objectives of their proposals and translating them into financial informational needs.
•	A desk based review of previous Ofwat price reviews and Water 2020 consultations, to inform your plan and proposals for implementation. 
•	Drafting outputs (see Deliverables below)
•	Discussion of outputs with key internal stakeholders within Ofwat and revision/ refinement of them as a result.

Key Deliverables

The Supplier will be required to produce the following deliverables, which fall into three phases. 

Phase 1: Developing a plan for Accounting Separation.
•	A plan for our Accounting Separation work, in the short, medium and long-term.
•	This should specify and explain the key activities that we need to undertake, the key issues to watch out for and the key water companies and other stakeholders to engage with.
•	It should also include a detailed monthly timetable (for the next two years) and quarterly thereafter, including milestones, people resources and external spend/ resources.
•	A key part of this work will involve identifying and understanding our regulatory and economic objectives and translating these into Accounting Separation and other financial informational needs.
The output would be a draft and final written report, with the option for Ofwat to meet the Supplier and suggest changes in between.
We envisage this Phase being around 2 weeks’ work.
Phases 2 and 3 follow from Phase 1 and we note that we may need to revise/ alter them significantly, depending on the result from the Phase 1 plan.

Phase 2: Implementation – Recommendations and Advice.
The Supplier should develop detailed recommendations and advice as to how we implement the plan. This will involve discussion with Ofwat and will be iterative/ evolve as we start to work on implementation over the next three months to March 2016 and beyond.

The output will be meetings with Ofwat and short memos (2/3 pages) on each recommendation/ issue, as we work through them.

Timescales: we see this as taking up to approximately 30 days over the three months January – March 2016.

Phase 3: Range of options to include in May 2016 consultation on Water 2020.
The Supplier should provide us with a menu of options and alternatives for us to consider for inclusion in our May 2016 consultation.",,,"West Midlands,London","79400000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,,,"For further information, please contact:  procurement@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk ",22/01/2016,31/03/2016,06/01/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,57056,,22/01/2016,57056,"[Jacobs UK Ltd|2 Colmore Square - 7th Floor

"ITT_531 (HS2_644)",Contract,"HIGH SPEED TWO (HS2) LIMITED",Awarded,2016-03-01T11:12:42Z,"Implementation Audit of Transport Model Development & Analysis","The PLANET Framework Model (PFM) is designed, maintained and used to forecast the impact on demand, revenue and benefits of rail schemes such as HS2. It is based on a model originally developed by the Strategic Rail Authority to support their high speed line study in 2001 but since then the model has been extensively developed, fully re-estimated and updated by HS2 Ltd.

Model development and day to day model use risks introducing human error or corruption of calculations. Incorrect or weak modelling could undermine both HS2 Ltd’s reputation and support for the project. HS2 Ltd has therefore established a multi-layered quality assurance (QA) regime to ensure our models and analysis are evidence based, transparent, results are understood and there are no material errors. Model audit to verify the implementation of model development and analysis is in line with the documented method and inputs is a key part of our QA regime and helps to ensure we comply with DfT’s QA guidance, “Strength in Numbers .”

The intention is to seek an External Provider of transport model audit services, who is demonstrably independent of any conflicting model development and analysis both at contract award and for the duration of the contract. The need for these services is anticipated to continue until approval of the Phase 2 Hybrid Bill, towards the end of the current Parliament.

Model audit will concern new transport models developed and used by HS2 Ltd and incremental enhancements and use of PFM. 

In future, as HS2 Ltd’s forecasting and modelling needs evolve, HS2 Ltd may wish to explore forecasting models other than PFM, therefore this contract should not limit itself to audit of PFM even though this would be the primary focus of the work over the next 1-2 years.

The Authorities may use this framework agreement where there may be areas of uncertainty or where the Authorities lack the internal capability or capacity to provide this type of resource.  The use of consultancy advice and resource will be mainly for the commissioning of internal projects to ensure effective service delivery of the Authorities' Transformation Programme. The Authorities have undertaken a substantial amount of transformation related projects in a range of different service areas. 
      
      The transformation journey of the Authorities has allowed for new areas of opportunity to be explored, as well as new ways of working. As such, the Authorities possess great degrees of knowledge and lessons that have been learnt throughout this journey. Where capacity permits, the Authorities are anticipating that they will be able to sell expertise and provide support to other organisations, to help drive their own individual journeys. This framework agreement will therefore have the scope to be able to be used by the Authorities when providing expertise and support for other organisations. The contractors listed on the framework agreement, when called-off, will be able to work with the Authorities, when the Authorities sell their knowledge and additional capacity.
      
      The Authorities may also use this framework agreement to second to and from those contractors who are listed in the agreement. This will be used where the Authorities would like to share the learning and in order to develop internal staff.

Each commission will be assessed on its individual merit and a tailored scope of works created for pricing, which could reflect any number of stages within the typical project life cycle, from design only, to full turn key packages.",,,"Any region","45000000 ","Paul Carroll",paul.carroll@oilandpipelines.com,"The Oil & Pipelines Agency, Aviation House, Zone A, First Floor","125 Kingsway",London,"WC2B 6NH",England,,,"notice.pdf ",,,30/09/2016,01/10/2020,15/08/2016,YES,OPA/T109,Yes,No,No,Services,500000,4000000,03/10/2016,4000000,"[ABB Limited|Daresbury, Daresbury Park, Warrington WA4 4BT|||No|No][Arch Henderson LLP|26 Rubislaw Terrace, Aberdeen AB10 1XE|||No|No][Bilfinger Industrial Services Ltd|Axis House, Tudor Road, Manor Park, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 1BD|||No|No][British Pipeline Agency Ltd|5 - 7 Alexandra Road, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire HP2 5BS|||No|No][Binary Systems & Engineering (UK) Ltd|1st Floor, 2 Woodberry Grove, North Finchley, London N12 0DR|||No|No][CH2M Hill United Kingdom|Elms House, 43 Brook Green, London W6 7EF|||No|No][Clark Eriksson Assoicates Ltd|St Crispins House, Williamson Street, Falkirk FK1 1PR|||No|No][Costain Oil, Gas & Process Ltd|Costain House, Vanwall Business Park, Maidenhead SL6 4UB|||No|No][Frazer Nash Consultancy Limited|c/o Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd., Devonport, Plymouth, Devon PL1 4SG|||No|No][Haskoningdhv UK Ltd|Rightwell House, Bretton Centre, Peterborough PE3 8DW|||No|No][Jacobs UK Ltd|1180 Eskdale Road, Winnersh, Wokingham RG41 5TU|||No|No][John Boyd Associates Ltd|17 Evolution, Wynyard Park, Billingham TS22 5TB|||No|No][Penspen Ltd|3 Water Lane, Richmond Upon Thames, Surrey TW9 1TJ|||No|No][Procom-IM Ltd|2nd Floor, Denmark Court, 18 Market Place, Wokingham, Berkshire RG40 1AL|||No|No][R B Plant Construction Ltd|R B House, The Square, Lenham ME17 2PG|||No|No][Simon Carves Engineering Ltd|Altitude, Atlas Park, Simonsway, Manchester M22 5PP|||No|No][SLR Consulting Ltd|7 Wornal Park, Menmarsh Road, Worminghall, Aylesbury HP18 9PH|||No|No][thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions Oil and Gas Ltd|Llewellyn House, Harbourside Business Park, Harbourside Road, Port Talbot SA13 1SB|||No|No][Tony Gee Partners LLP|Hardy House, 140 High Street, Esher KT10 9QJ|||No|No]",,15/11/2016,20/10/2018,"Open ",

Cornwall Council currently has in place a direct ‘passporting’ of appropriate works arrangement with CORMAC Solutions. CORMAC Solutions will therefore act as the main body responsible for managing the Topographical Surveys Framework.
Topographical surveys are typically requested from our Engineering & Structures Design Groups (EDG & SDG) prior to preliminary design works for highways schemes. The requirements can range from a large survey for a proposed town/village bypass, down to small scale junction improvements or road realignments. Surveys are also required of existing bridges, culverts or retaining walls where a lot of detail may be required in a small area for potential strengthening or replacement schemes. In addition, surveys can also be requested from our Engineering Services Laboratory (ESL) for the location of boreholes, trial pits or of embankments for stabilisation schemes.
Other aspects of the commission could include monitoring slopes and structures for movement, provision of Park and Ride facilities and regeneration of towns and villages.
Although the majority of the surveys are small to medium in size, it is important to ensure that any supplier has the capacity to undertake large scale surveys with sufficient resources.
In addition the range of services procured through the Contract may be developed and expanded in consultation with the Consultant to suit particular areas of expertise available from both Parties to the Contract.
The intention is to appoint the three Contractors submitting the most economically advantageous tenders to CORMAC Solutions having regard to both quality and price.",,,"South West","71351000 ","Gemma Parker",procurement@cormacltd.co.uk,"CORMAC Solutions Ltd","Higher Trenant Road",Wadebridge,"PL27 6TW",England,01872323313,www.cormacltd.co.uk,,,"To submit an expression of interest please email Gemma Parker at: procurement@cormacltd.co.uk.

This is to replace Centro's existing framework that expires on 30th September 2015.

The framework will consist of 4 Lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Project Development and Delivery

Lot 2 - Transport Planning

Lot 3 - Project Management and Programme Management Office

Lot 4 - Market Research and Data Processing

Centro is proposing to qualify either 1, 3 or 4 consultants to each Lot of the framework and will usually undertake a suitable mini competition process to award each call-off.

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

Tenders are due back by the closing date of 12 noon on Monday 24th August 2015 and the deadline for clarification questions is 12 noon on Monday 17th August 2015.

Centro is holding a pre-tender Briefing Session for all interested bidders for this framework on Tuesday 14th July 2015 at Centro House, 16 Summer Lane, Birmingham, B19 3SD from 1100 - 1300. if this is of interest would you please confirm your attendance by 1200 on Monday 13th July 2015.

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

As this is a Framework Agreement it is not known at this stage what the aggregate value of spend will be across the various Lots over the duration of the framework in terms of Centro spend or spend incurred by the various organisations that can access and order directly from the framework. It is not the intention that Centro uses the framework to procure on behalf of other organisations rather that other public bodies have access to it and procure directly from the qualified suppliers for the Lot(s) concerned.

Please note that this is a one stage process where bidders will be asked to submit a PQQ at the same time as submitting their bid for the Lot(s) concerned (only 1 PQQ submission is required regardless of how many ITT's are being submitted). Only those responses that meet the minimum PQQ criteria will go on to have their tenders evaluated.
