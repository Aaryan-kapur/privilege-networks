The SWDPR is seeking to balance the areas future needs for housing and employment growth with its environmental limitations (including flood risk). The SWC initially require a level 1 SFRA and associated Water Cycle Study to identify the potential flood risks across the districts, followed by further flood risk assessment work to determine the suitability of 'preferred' development sites as they emerge through the SWDPR process to help produce a robust, detailed and up to date evidence base.  Following on from this a further stage of work may be required to produce a more detailed assessment of the flooding implications of options for development sites only if land outside flood risk areas can't appropriately accommodate all the necessary development and the National Planning Policy Framework's Exception Test needs to be applied (separate to this tender).  All work produced must factor in Climate Change and assess the impact that land use changes and development in the area will have on flood risk.",,,"West Midlands","71800000 73000000 79400000 ",,procurement@malvernhills.gov.uk,"The Council House","Avenue Road",Malvern,"WR14 3AF","United Kingdom",,http://www.malvernhills.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=2851e039-6aaf-e811-80ed-005056b64545 ",,17/10/2018,31/03/2019,28/09/2018,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,37095,,12/10/2018,37095.5,"[Jeremy Benn Associates LTD|South Barn, Broughton Hall, Skipton, North Yorkshire, BD23 3AE|NONE||No|No]",,17/10/2018,31/03/2019,"Other ",
