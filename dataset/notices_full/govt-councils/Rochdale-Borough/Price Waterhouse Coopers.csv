The Flexible Facility Service Provider will, on an as-needed basis, design and implement business environment, access to finance and anti-corruption interventions in order to contribute to private sector development and poverty alleviation in DRC. This work will commence with a programme of support to the Government of DRC for the implementation of OHADA law, practices and institutions. Subsequent interventions will be designated by DFID DRC via the mechanisms specified in section 4 below.
The Flexible Facility Service Provider will contribute to the achievement of outcome indicator 1 of the log frame for DFID DRC’s Private Sector Development Programme: to support DRC to reduce its distance to the frontier of the World Bank Doing Business Indicators from 35 to 52.  Detailed, intervention-specific log frames for the Flexible Facility Service Provider will be developed during the inception phase of each intervention and agreed by DFID DRC as specified in section 5 below. 
The expected duration of the Flexible Facility is five years with an approximate budget of £35 million. This budget includes the service provider’s management costs as well as the design and implementation costs of any interventions. Note that, given the nature of this programme, expenditure will proceed incrementally up to this budget ceiling depending on the emergence of intervention opportunities and progress against results and value for money metrics. If suitable opportunities do not arise, or insufficient progress is made, the budget and duration of the facility will be reduced. Conversely, there is scope to increase this budget if sufficient interventions are identified and if on-going monitoring, evaluation, and analysis suggest that such a rebalancing would be warranted.",,,"Any region","75211000 ","Public enquiry",enquiry@dfid.gov.uk,"Abercrombie house",,"East Kilbride","G75 8EA",Scotland,,,"PO 6624 Call Down Contract.zip ",,,06/01/2015,05/01/2020,07/05/2014,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,34999271,,19/12/2014,34999271,"[Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP|7 More London Riverside|||No|No]",,06/01/2015,05/01/2020,"Negotiated ",
