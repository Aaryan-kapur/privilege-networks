Prior to the pandemic, the health and care system in London faced operational, workforce and estates pressures in all care settings. ICSs analysed their population's health needs and prepared detailed plans to meet them through the delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan. COVID-19 has bought new challenges to the health and care system and will continue to circulate in the community and create demand for NHS services beyond the original forecasts and plans. This creates a fundamentally different set of challenges that need to meet by the London region.

To meet these challenges London has rapidly put together a high-level strategic plan (Journey to a new health and care system) that has the buy-in of the Trusts and the ICS leads. It sets out 12 expectations and outlines 8 core tests that will help the system know when it is succeeding against its ambition and its recovery plan. 

To set up and control a programme of work to deliver on these new targets is a complex task. This is made additionally so by the need for rapid delivery whilst incorporating new guidance which is being introduce daily for example the introduction of new infection control measures.

Outside consultancy has been requested to bring independent advice and external knowledge (such as experience of WHO approaches to recovery) to the set-up of the programme. This is a short term need specifically focused on a series of key deliverables to ensure we get the set-up right first time for London.

Appropriate consideration of the financing and delivery options for an UDWP and possible forms of government support should be made. The analysis and final report will be used to:
(i) inform and provide an evidence base for potential government investment or involvement in an UDWP and multi-use yard.
(ii) inform work in relation to the overall policy framework of North Sea decommissioning.

These services require the supplier to draw upon a range of disciplines, experience and knowledge including government finance, budgeting, finance systems, technical accounting skills and project and programme management and delivery. 
MoJ has agreed to source this service by putting in place a framework agreement, which can also be accessed by the Home Office, HM Treasury and all of their associated arm’s length bodies. The framework will be established with up to 6 suppliers. 
Given the complex nature of change initiatives, the suppliers' multi-disciplinary teams are expected to comprise experienced professionals who have completed professional qualifications in their area of expertise. It is expected that the team provided will be solely dedicated to the engagement for its duration in order to support and prioritise effective delivery. The teams will be required to work alongside our internal teams and integrate effectively at our locations. The following core elements of the requirement are to be:

• Resource Delivery Model - Resources will be tasked with developing their own delivery plans as part of the engagement with change teams, ensuring plans meet overall delivery objectives. Resources will be responsible for delivering to agreed milestones and providing the relevant project input to programme and portfolio oversight teams. 
• Technical Accounting Expertise - Resources shall be expected to provide expert technical knowledge, research, expertise and support to change teams, have relevant and up-to-date technical knowledge of the broader financial regulatory frameworks, and be well versed in Government reporting and budgeting regulation. 
• Advocacy - Resources will be expected to embed full-time alongside existing change teams to proactively identify issues, highlighting implications and proposing suitable solutions or alternative methodology to achieve required outcomes. Resources will be expected to engage and influence internal and external stakeholders to drive issues through to conclusion. 
• Finance Improvement Activities - Resources will be expected to identify and implement finance improvement activities, including system and process design, implementation and broader advice on the requirements for ongoing monitoring of activity, including how governance and assurance processes should operate to ensure the requisite level of senior management scrutiny is maintained. 
• Knowledge Transfer - Resources will be required to propose plans for increasing the skills of in-house staff and an agreed process to ensure knowledge transfer at the conclusion of work packages. Resources will also be required to demonstrate how they will make this happen and how they will deliver value for money both through their direct work and through the enhancement of in-house capability.",,,"South East","79200000 79400000 ","Charlotte Dodden",charlotte.dodden@justice.gsi.gov.uk,"Ministry of Justice","102 Petty France",London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,,23/09/2015,23/09/2018,09/06/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,20000000,50000000,23/09/2015,0,"[Allen Lane Consultancy Limited|30 City Road
