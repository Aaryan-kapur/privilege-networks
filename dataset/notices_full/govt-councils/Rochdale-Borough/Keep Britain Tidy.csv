The SWP is looking to carry out the doorstepping campaign in mid-low performing recycling rounds, which have high levels of contamination, within 9 of its 11 authorities (not including Epsom & Ewell Borough Council and Reigate & Banstead Borough Council). These rounds include both individual households and households of multiple occupancy. 

As both low recycling rates and contaminated recycling continue to be an issue in parts of Surrey, the SWP would like the doorstepping to address these issues with targeted messages and conversations. By being able to speak face to face in targeted areas, doorsteppers will be able to tackle the resident barriers to recycling and recycling the correct materials.
