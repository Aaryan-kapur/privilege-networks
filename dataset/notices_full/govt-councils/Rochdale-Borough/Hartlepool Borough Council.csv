Local leaders have agreed that it is critical that services are joined up and seamless for those that need support. It is important that the commissioned service (as set out in this service specification) is integrated with the council internal offer and as such we want any prospective providers to embrace this approach. 
We want to work with the provider to design and develop the offer with the following expectations:
•	The two elements of the offer (commissioned and in house council) will be overseen by one clinical governance process to ensure that pathways are seamless. 
•	The council will appoint a Clinical Lead to have strategic management oversight of the whole offer.  
•	To brand the offer which includes the two elements as one service
•	Provision of a single co-located clinical service based in new premises and a one stop shop model augmented by a separate recovery hub (premises to be provided by the council)
•	The council will provide admin to support the whole service 
We feel this is an exciting opportunity to radically redesign services to meet the needs of the people in Hartlepool.

acting through the Education and Skills Funding Agency (the ""ESFA""). The ESFA is an
executive agency of the Department for Education, exercising functions to fund adult
education and skills.
The ESFA, acting as a Co-Financing Organisation for the European Social Fund
(""ESF""), is procuring education and training services to meet priorities identified by
Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) area European Structural and Investment Funds
Sub-Committees. As a Co-Financing Organisation, the ESFA provides match funding at
Priority Axis level utilising sources of funding as match for ESF funded activity.
The invitation to tender is for Priority Axis 1. Priority Axis 1 supports activity to increase
participation in the labour market and thereby improve social inclusion and mobility. The ESFA wishes to make ESF Community Grants available in the form of small grants
(up to £20,000) to third sector and other small organisations for the purpose of
mobilising disadvantaged or excluded unemployed and inactive people to enable their
progress towards employment. Organisations that access grants need to be well placed
to reach excluded individuals facing barriers, which hinder their access to mainstream
provision Grants will:
 engage with marginalised individuals and support them to re-engage with
education, training, or employment;
 will support a range of activities aimed at assisting the disadvantaged or
excluded to move closer to the labour market by improving their access to
mainstream ESF and domestic employment and skills provision; and
 will provide support to the hardest to reach communities and individuals,
especially those from deprived communities, to access employment or further
learning and training.",,,"United Kingdom,Isle of Man,Channel Islands","80000000 ",ESFA,ESFAProcurement.HELP@education.gov.uk,"Cheylesmore House","Quinton Road",Coventry,"CV1 2WT",England,02476660202,,"IP1.4 CG Lot 1 BlackCountry Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council.pdf IP1.4 CG Lot 4 CoastCapital London Learning Consortium Community Interest Company.pdf IP1.4 CG Lot 6 CovWarks The Federation of Groundwork Trusts.pdf IP1.4 CG Lot 8 DerbyNotts Futures Advice, Skills and Employment Limited.pdf IP1.4 CG Lot 9 Dorset Groundwork London.pdf IP1.4 CG Lot 15 GtManc Workers&apos;
