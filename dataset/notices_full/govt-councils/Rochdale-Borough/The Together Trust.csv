This outreach service will work in collaboration with Sefton SEN and Inclusion Service to provide support for practitioners in mainstream schools and other educational settings in order to remove barriers to learning and optimise the educational outcomes for children and young people experiencing these types of difficulties.
Current arrangements for the provision of outreach support for children and young people with social communication, social interaction and/or ASD are supplemented through the use of an external provider, Autism Initiatives.  This educational outreach service is delivered through a service level agreement and focuses on the development of bespoke packages of support for individual pupils that are implemented, for the main part, by school based staff.  This service is an important element of the Sefton Local Offer and is available to children and young people living in Sefton across the borough. It ensures that families can choose to have their child's needs supported in their local school, which is in line with the general presumption in law of mainstream education in relation to decisions about where children and young people with special education needs should be educated.
The existing arrangements will remain in place until 1st September 2016, by which time it is anticipated that Sefton Council will have awarded a new contract for an outreach service for schools, to support children and young people experiencing difficulties with social communication, social interaction and/or who have ASD, that meets local needs. The procurement and award of the contract will be achieved through an OJEU Light-Touch Regime tender process. Submissions will be invited from suitably experienced and qualified organisations to deliver this service as the sole contractor.

Due to the estimated discharges in the next 12 months within the Pan-Lancashire area, a Flexible Agreement has been developed. This is intended to be an interim agreement and will initially be in place for one year with the option to extend for up to a further three years if required.  This is to allow the time to develop further commissioning options for Transforming Care whilst allowing us to have an initial agreement in operation as early as October 2016, to allow Transforming Care placements to be commissioned with suitably selected providers via this Flexible Agreement.
Social value has been considered throughout the development of the service specification and is part of the evaluation methodology.
Please note that the original RFQ in relation to this tender has been amended due to a revision to the selection criteria in relation to CQC ratings.

LCC requires a Provider to be registered with CQC for the regulated activity of Personal Care by the tender deadline of the 12th August 2016 however if a Provider nominates an office that is currently unrated as it has not yet been inspected by CQC then your Submission will not be disregarded on that basis, however at the point when the office has its first inspection you must inform the lead officer immediately and your nominated office must meet the requirements of either outstanding, good or requires improvement (latter with robust justification). Prior to contract award where the status of your nominated office does not meet the requirements for the Flexible Agreement your Submission will be disregarded. Following contract award if any provider is given an overall rating of requires improvement or inadequate for the nominated office the Contracting Body reserves the right to suspend/terminate the agreement depending on its own judgement.  

The RFQ on the e-tendering system has been amended to reflect this along with all the tender documents. The tender deadline will be extended to the 12/08/16 to allow providers sufficient time to consider submitting a bid having taken into account the revised criteria.",,,"North West","85000000 ","Joanne Sherborne",joanne.sherborne@lancashire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Christ Church Precinct","County Hall",Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"01772 531427",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41137&e=e ","Please Note:  Value of Contract

• Children's basic need for good parenting is met.

Specific outcomes will also be discussed, agreed and recorded within the Service User's Care Plan.

It is intended that call-offs from the framework will be administered by the Council's Access to Resources Team. Referrals will be sent out to service providers who will need to indicate whether they can offer a placement. The final decision on which offers are suitable will be made by the social worker, and if more than one suitable offer is identified the decision will be based upon lowest cost per week.",,,"North West","85000000 ","James Mynott",james.mynott@lancashire.gov.uk,"Lancashire Procurement Service, Christ Church Precinct, Floor 2","County Hall Complex",Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"01772 532655",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41880 ",,05/04/2018,04/04/2020,07/11/2017,YES,"Care &amp; Public Health - 560",Yes,No,No,Services,80000000,,24/03/2018,80000000,"[Acorn House|Chambers Business Centre,
