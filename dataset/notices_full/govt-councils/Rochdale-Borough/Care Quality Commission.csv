Background and overview

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has a statutory duty to have regard to the views and experiences of people who use services in its regulatory work.

Listening to and acting on people’s experiences of care is vital to our work. It  helps us to decide when, where and what to inspect, supports better  registration, inspection, judgements and ratings and results in better information for the public.  
Some national voluntary organisations that run a telephone helpline service have access to a rich source of qualitative intelligence from the public about the quality and safety of health and social care services in England which could be extremely valuable to CQC.  

CQC wishes to commission a national voluntary organisation, (that runs a telephone helpline service) to provide a continuous feed of qualitative intelligence about people’s experiences of care at named health and social care services via CQC’s Share Your Experience form.

Our aim is to make sure better care is provided for everyone, whether that's in hospital, in care homes, in people's own homes, or elsewhere. We regulate health and adult social care services, whether provided by the NHS, local authorities, private companies or voluntary organisations. We also protect the rights of people detained under the Mental Health Act. From April 2010, all health and social care providers have been required by law to register with the Care Quality Commission if they provide “regulated activities.” The Organisation has registered the NHS, social care providers, dentists and primary medical services (GP practices). It is also moving to new online systems and processes for initial registration and associated ongoing account maintenance. More recently CQC has restructured splitting the inspection work across three new Inspectorates headed up by new Chief inspectors. Each of these Inspectorates is in the process of implementing new more intensive ways of inspection and rating organisations in each of the sectors we regulate. In addition CQC is looking to change the processes of registration. These new inspection and registration methodologies require new information models. So far we have redesigned the core of the new acute hospital model and started work on Adult Social Care and Primary Medical Services. We are aiming to maintain commonality across the models wherever possible in order to maintain efficiency within the organisation. The previous modelling work has proved to be highly beneficial in the design and development of new process and system and we wish to continue to build on this benefit. Through all of this change we have built on the old categorisations of the organisations as they came under the new registration process adding new categories as required. This is becoming unsustainable and we need to complete a full review of these taxonomies and create a new one that will answer the requirements of the organisation in a much more consistent maintainable way",,,London,"73000000 ",,procurement@cqc.org.uk,Citygate,Gallowgate,"Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 4PA",England,,,"20150615 CQC PSO 03_Redacted.pdf ",,,27/11/2014,31/03/2015,27/10/2014,NO,,Yes,No,No,NotApplicable,39950,,27/11/2014,39950,"[Altis Consulting|26 Red Lion Square

Experts by Experience are individuals who have personal experience of using or caring for people who use health and or social care services. They work with CQC inspectors on inspections of health and social care services and visits to monitor the use of the Mental Health Act.  They can also take part in other aspects of CQCs work, such as developing effective methodologies

In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, people who have experience of using services are increasingly recognised as being able to make an important contribution to the design and delivery of those services. So, for example, people with a lived experience of mental health conditions, or caring for someone with long-term health problems can offer advice to decision-makers which is distinct from and may be complementary to professional views of how to deliver services.  
see: http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/should-we-use-experts-experience-outside-health-and-social-care

In the Care Quality Commission, the Experts by Experience programme has been running for several years, employing the expertise of people with experience of using services, or caring for people who use services, in inspections, registration and Mental Health Act monitoring visits to ensure that we can include this perspective in our assessments and can effectively gather the views of people using the services we are assessing in our reports. 

Experts take part in inspections of health and social care services as members of the inspection team and also in our other statutory functions such as registration and monitoring the application of the Mental Health Act. They are also involved in a range of other activities such as helping us to develop our ways of working, co-producing public information, taking part in events and consultations, CQC staff training, local and national media.  We currently work with around 500 Experts by Experience and with a number of national and local support organisations. Support organisations play a crucial role in the programme, recruiting Experts on our behalf, offering appropriate training, undertaking DBS checks and supporting Experts in their work for CQC.  The Commission has called for expressions of interest in a re-tendering process to identify support organisations to continue the programme. The re-tendering process is scheduled to begin in April 2015.

During our inspections, Experts spend time talking to people who use the service and observing the environment. Their first-hand experience of receiving care enables them to gather evidence to help us assess the quality of care from the perspective of people using services.  Their findings are used to support the inspection team’s judgments on the quality of care provided by a service and can also be included in the inspection report.",,,"Any region","73200000 ",,Procurement@cqc.org.uk,"Finsbury Tower","103-105 Bunhill Road",London,"EC1Y 8TG",England,,,"20150717 CQC PSO 015 The Evaluation of Experts by Experience Programme_Redacted.pdf ",,,01/07/2015,31/12/2015,18/03/2015,NO,,No,No,No,NotApplicable,81799,,01/06/2015,81799,"[OPM|252B Gray's Inn Road

This can be deliberate or unintentional - either way it can cause unacceptable harm to a person and their loved ones.

We monitor, inspect and regulate services to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and we publish what we find including performance ratings to help people choose care.

•	Engaging with people with lived experience (specific population groups below) on the Closed cultures project

We monitor, inspect and regulate services to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and we publish what we find including performance ratings to help people choose care.  

Public engagement and insight is integral to ensuring CQC delivers its purpose. It enables us to understand what matters to people who use services, consequently helping to build public trust. This empowers the public to make choices around services and know what they should expect in terms of quality of care. It also enables CQC to meet its statutory requirements as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (and amended in 2013). 

CQC require research to be commissioned and undertaken by an external supplier as we do not have the internal resources or skills to deliver this research at premises or on-line.

CQC will lead on the design of the research questions in collaboration with the research company, however, it is vital that the methodology is executed and results analysed independently of CQC to ensure a robust evidence based approach to our public engagement activity.

CQC require the procurement of a single external supplier to undertake research into four areas which support the delivery of key priorities within the CQC Strategy 2016-2021, in terms of:

1.	Building effective partnerships with voluntary and community sector partners to encourage improvement, innovation, sustainability in care (Priority 1)

2.	Supporting development of information products and processes to deliver an intelligence-driven approach to regulation (Priority 2)

CQC aspires to become a more intelligence driven organisation, and target inspection resources more effectively. As part of our regulation we have an inspection programme covering tens of thousands of NHS and independent hospitals, GPs, dentists, care homes and other health and care providers. 

We are working to become more intelligence driven in our approach and seeking to develop a decision support tool using artificial intelligence that helps our inspectors decide what action to take on receipt of new information about a provider.

We have developed a framework for this tool and are looking to test two aspects of this framework before making a business case for further investment. This proof of concept will focus on the statutory notifications that we receive in adult social care but we expect to be able to extend it to other information sources and sectors in time.

We are seeking bids to develop and test an ontology that makes meaningful connections between notifications received over time, and classifiers that automatically tag documents against this ontology. Some of these classifiers may need to be based on free text captured as part of the notification.

We expect the bid to include details of the testing step, for which we will provide a pool of inspectors able to ground truth the output of the system.

If the concept is successfully demonstrated, then we will develop a business case for extending the system and making it operational via a further procurement exercise. We expect to be able to base an extended system on the ontology and classifiers developed as a part of this project.

The anticipated award for this contract will be January 2019.

In the last financial year, we worked with an economics consultancy to look at what is possible to achieve in terms of measuring our costs and benefits and developing a framework for doing this. This identified a number of data gaps, particularly around understanding the costs of our regulation to providers and the benefits from our regulation to providers (and ultimately to people using services in terms of better care).

1.	The language the CQC uses, both internally and externally, to explain why it wants to hear from people, and what we will do with the information they give us.  The “conversations” that take place (on the telephone, online and in writing) between employees within CQC and between the CQC and people outside the organisation, often raise expectations about what CQC is empowered to do in relation to investigating and resolving individual people’s personal experiences.  The confusion around the language used means that people outside the organisation are getting frustrated with the way their feedback is handled by the CQC, and people inside the CQC are unclear about what they can, and cannot, say and do to support the people who contact the CQC.

2.	The way the CQC’s internal processes have developed over time in response to changing external expectations and regulatory developments.  This means that CQC systems and processes have not always been designed with the “customer” at the centre, and often reflect our internal organisational structures rather than the needs and expectations of people who contact CQC to give feedback about their, or others, experience.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,Procurement@cqc.org.uk,Citygate,,Gallowgate,"NE1 4PA",England,,,"20150511 CQC PS0 07  Redacted Linguistic Landscapes Ltd Conversation Analysis and Improvement.pdf ",,,07/04/2015,30/06/2015,18/12/2014,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,49850,,07/04/2015,49850,"[Linguistic Landscapes|Cardinal House

"Care Quality Commission CQC PSO 08",Contract,"Care Quality Commission",Awarded,2015-05-26T15:03:14Z,"Customer Journey Mapping Service User Feedback","Customer Journey Mapping: Service User Feedback Project has been designed to help us look at our current systems and processes through the eyes of members of the public who have experienced poor care, or whose family members have done so, and who contacts us to give us feedback. This could include feedback about any regulated service providers such as hospitals, care homes, home care and GP and dentist surgeries. 

Through developing a better understanding of the end–to-end experience of giving feedback to CQC; from them deciding to contact us, through to how we handle their feedback and then let them know what has happened as a result; we will be able to redesign our internal systems and processes to deliver a better experience for everyone. 

There are four groups of people who we want to provide feedback to CQC:
i.	People who have received a poor service themselves, or whose family member has
ii.	People who work in a service and witnessed poor service (service whistleblowers)
iii.	People who want to complain about CQC itself (often after they were in group i)
iv.	People who work for CQC raising issues about CQC activities (CQC whistleblowers)

This project focuses on the first and second groups, but part of the project is to provide the tools for internal resources to be able to conduct future customer journey mapping exercises for the other two groups.

Two actual customer experiences will be used as the basis for mapping how it feels to contact CQC - one for poor care received from a provider and the other from a person who has worked in a service and witnessed poor service (a service whistleblower)",,,"Any region","73200000 ",,Procurement@cqc.org.uk,Citygate,,Gallowgate,"NE1 4PA",England,,,"20150513 CQC PSO 08 H2 Experience Ltd Customer Journey Mapping Service User Feedback.pdf ",,,05/04/2015,30/06/2015,07/01/2015,NO,,Yes,No,No,NotApplicable,20500,,05/04/2015,20500,"[H2 Experience Limited|The Byre

CQC’s purpose is to make sure health and social care services provide people with safe, effective, compassionate, high-quality care and we encourage them to improve. It carries out that purpose by monitoring, inspecting and regulating services to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and it publishes its findings, including performance ratings to help people choose care. 
CQC regulates different services in different ways, based on what matters to people and make use of tailored information and expert inspection to assess health and social care services.
To support that, CQC is undertaking a recruitment campaign that will result in the employment of 1,000 new staff by December 2015, who will be a mix of inspectors with specialist knowledge of care, managers, data analysts and other specialist and some generalist roles. It is evident that there are differing information needs to support the assessment of applications for different roles
CQC recognises that different modes of application will be preferred by candidates, based on personal preference and industry norms. As it has been difficult to attract successful candidates, CQC needs to ensure that all modes of application are available and easy to access by candidates.
The employment of 1,000 staff is likely to result in several thousand applications and CQC is devolving the assessment of those applications to the internal teams responsible for those areas and other specialists as required.
The anticipated breakdown of those roles are:
•	600 Inspectors 
•	100 Inspection Managers 
•	70 data analysts 
•	At least 200 further general roles
In order to enable the centralised management of that process within CQC by a small number of recruitment staff, it requires an applicant tracking service and is asking suppliers to bid for the provision of that service. 
In order to effectively assess, manage and report on that volume and variety of modes and types of application, it is anticipated that the service will need to enable some of the information associated with an application to be standardised at the point of submission. However, suppliers are invited to propose alternative approaches.
CQC often works with other organisations to carry out specialised assessment of candidates.
CQC needs to initiate this recruitment process quickly and so is expecting suppliers to provide a standardised commodity service that can be quickly implemented within its recruitment processes.",,,"Any region","72000000 ",,procurement@cqc.org.uk,Citygate,Gallowgate,"Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 4PA",England,,,"20150427 CQC ICTC 220 Bramble Hub Limited_Redacted.pdf ",,,31/12/2014,30/12/2016,20/11/2014,NO,,No,No,No,NotApplicable,56000,,31/12/2014,56000,"[Bramble Hub Ltd|9e Embankment

This project seeks to understand and describe
•	How safety of care in the adult social care sector is currently defined, measured and monitored.  	This should include commentary on how the sector addresses ‘best interests’ decisions i.e. to 	respect patient choice or to prioritise patient safety and the impact of the Mental Capacity Act 	2005 in this area. 
•	How safety of care is reported and managed
•	How safety incidents are learned from and services are ‘future proofed’ as a result
•	Whether, and how, the sector distinguishes safety and safeguarding. 

	This piece of work will support CQC in inspecting and monitoring safety more effectively in adult 	social care and support providers to understand what CQC will be looking at when assessing 	safety 	performance.


We would expect the research activity to address the following questions:-
1. What frameworks/best practice/guidance exists in the ASC sector on safety systems and processes including those to identify, report, investigate and learn from safety concerns? Where they exist, how extensively are they used?
2. How consistently is safety assessed and managed across the ASC sector?  Does this differ depending on the type of service and/or size, and business model of the provider? 
3. Are there any international models or frameworks for assessing and managing safety in ASC and if so, what are their key features and how effective are these?
4. What is the ASC sector understanding of “safety” and “safeguarding”?  To what extent does it distinguish between the two in practice?
5. To the extent that there is blurring of distinctions between approaches to managing safety and safeguarding, what would be the risks and benefits of developing more distinct approaches and processes – e.g for identifying, reporting, investigating and learning from safety incidents and safeguarding incidents?
6. Using the research what approaches can be suggested on how CQC could identify risk and measure safety in ASC e.g. through intelligent monitoring, provider returns or during inspections?",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,Procurement@cqc.org.uk,"Citygate Gallowgate",,"Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 4PA",England,,,,,,01/04/2015,31/07/2015,25/02/2015,NO,,No,No,No,NotApplicable,32955,,31/03/2015,32955,"[Skills for Care Solutions Ltd|West Gate

Primarily the contractor is required to provide resources to carry out an assessment of the forty four ASC providers’ company finance, accounts and debt structures. 
Core capabilities required include the ability to provide:
•	Interpretation of information from providers, based on information provided to CQC from the providers, via  a financial submission template covering standard financial indicators; . 
•	timely, detailed financial advice and analysis to service risk assessment judgments;
•	An opinion on where each Corporate Provider sits on the operating model;
•	Assessment of likely or imminent failure. 
This is a highly specialised area and the skill set and experience required for the task is a key requirement to meet the overall objective of assuring CQC that the financial and business aspects of companies providing care services are viable. 
Commercial expertise and/or a detailed banking or restructuring background is a key asset in enabling this role, as highly specialised skills and knowledge is required of complex company accounting, lending, refinancing, debt and repayment strategies.
CQC has published  guidance for providers. The guidance is available on the CQC website  The tasks and activties set out below support the delivery of the MO operating model.
The tasks:
There are 3 key blocks of activity being sought 
Activity One:
•	Provide named contacts for each  the 44 providers to have single point of contact on financial risk assessment 
•	Resolve any queries from providers about how to complete the financial submission template, for example at what level of the Group information should be provided.

In delivering these activities, please note that CQC has developed a Financial Submission template.  In Appendix C is a summary of this template, which lists the indicators which are included.   CQC  has a secure portal for information exchange between CQC and the providers and this will be needed to be used as the primary storage of information 

Activity Two:
Confirm that the following have not changed
o	Group structure, including the structure of its registered providers registered with CQC
o	Shareholders
o	Lenders
o	Properties

This task may be completed by analysing publicly available information; information provided by the provider and may need to be supplemented with discussions with the providers in question.

Activity Three
•	Each quarters performance can be assessed against recent performance and
anticipated future performance from the business plan   

•	When the data submissions are received (6 weeks after quarter end), carry out analysis of potential financial risk. The assessment should as a minimum cover:
•	Is trading improving or deteriorating?
•	Is there too much debt?
•	Can they afford to pay their debts?
•	Is the annual budget deliverable?
•	Where are they on the operating model?",,,"Any region","79000000 ","CQC PSO 064 Financial Assessment Adult Social Care Providers",commercialcontracts@cqc.org.uk,"151 Buckingham Palace Road",,London,"SW1W 9SZ",England,,,"20160205 CQC PSO 064 Market Oversight Interim_Redacted.pdf ",,,01/10/2015,31/03/2016,08/09/2015,NO,,No,No,No,Services,176889,,28/09/2015,176889,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

The majority of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians currently are in NHS trusts and Foundation trusts and the new E-Learning will need to reflect the direction of travel towards a fully integrated approach across the patient pathway applicable to Guardians in secondary care, primary care i.e. GP, optometry, pharmacy and dentistry, regulators and other non-provider organisations e.g. arms' length bodies.  It will be available on the new NGO website.

•	The e-learning will be the main part of the training (Part 1) and will be followed up with an interactive face to face session in the form of an Action Learning Set or similar facilitative discussion (Part 2).  It is intended that the learning should be modular in nature and each element capable of standing alone, which it is hoped will also answer the need for Guardians to undertake annual refresher learning.

•	We would want to work in close collaboration about the content and design of the e-learning but input and expertise will be sought and welcome from the successful supplier

We commissioned a Visual Thinking project focusing on the core ‘story’ around change  - creating an accessible and engaging visual tool that could be agreed across leadership as the single representation of the change journey and our ‘direction of travel’. This will then become part of a wider suite of management tools enabling us to marble change throughout the organisation by enabling leaders to take ownership of messaging and communicate effectively to their teams.
As the project progressed, it threw up more questions and it became increasingly apparent that there was a need for some broader and deeper understanding to support a comprehensive and rigorous review of an ongoing Internal Engagement strategy. These additional areas include:
1.	Audience segmentation: Creation of ‘personas’ to identify key internal audiences to allow more targeted communications and a deeper understanding of their communication needs
2.	Channel review: Research into effective communications channels feeding into the audience segmentation piece
3.	Strategy Document: Consultancy on an existing engagement strategy to take into account the new findings above findings to create a fully integrated approach, while also building-in industry best practice and benchmarking into our approach

These are essential projects to the successful review and creation of the Internal Engagement strategy that will take us through the next two to three years. The creation and adoption of a new Internal Engagement strategy is critical to the continuing delivery of our transformation and continuous improvement.

	THE REQUIREMENT
The project covers the three distinct areas outlined below but a key requirement is that all three link-up fully to deliver an integrated and coherent strategic direction.

What we want you to do:
o	Audience segmentation: Identify key internal audiences that reflect our core workers, and design and facilitate workshops across CQC, with a range of employees to substantiate and create ‘personas’ - allowing more targeted communications and a deeper understanding of range of CQC employee communication needs. The workshop input will need to be analysed in light of an in depth knowledge of the organization and lead to recommended communications priorities which will inform both the strategy and related channel review

o	Channel review: Research into effective communications channels feeding into the audience segmentation piece. The consultant will again be able to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the organization, its current channel mix and digest research to date to inform the basis of their approach.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,Procurement@cqc.org.uk,Citygate,Gallowgate,"Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 4PA",England,,,"20150312  CQC AM 051 Visual Thinking_Redacted.pdf ",,,20/01/2015,20/03/2015,19/01/2015,NO,,No,No,No,NotApplicable,28861,,19/01/2015,28861,"[This Is Home|4 Dulce Road

The CQC target operating model will articulate what the organisation will look like in the future, defining everything from the business processes, technology and physical estate we will need to the cultural and leadership behaviors we will require. Essentially it will depict 'what we do and how we do it, who we are and how we behave'. 

We require the support of consultancy services to undertake this exercise as we do not have the expert in-house capability to undertake such a task within the necessary timescales. The programme will however, be headed up by experienced Programme Director who is familiar with executing such initiatives, and a small internal team. It is our intention to build our internal capacity over the 6-month duration so that we are able to own and drive the implementation of the TOM beyond its approval.

However, it has now become clear that CQC require more change from CACI than the OAS scheme is capable of. This is in part due to CQC's own system administration team becoming more proficient with the Cygnum system and being able to affect small changes (that would previously have come to CACI on the scheme) to the system themselves, but also many of the emerging CQC requirements for change require a level of development from CACI that is greater than the 5   days cap afforded in the OAS.  It is not good value for money for CQC  to have a series of large releases for change work as has happened previously.  There is need to have a flexible approach to the frequent and medium sized requirements that are likely.

"CQC PSO 109",Contract,"Care Quality Commission",Awarded,2017-07-06T11:41:26Z,"Business Change","Over the last 2 years, CQC has begun to realise the value and benefit of having a documented operating model and how this feeds the underpinning business architecture of the organisation. The first call-off from this contract, below, will detail the requirements of how CQC intends to fill the gap in its existing business process knowledge, create our existing operating model and support CQC in defining our target operating model.

CQC does not have the capability or capacity within its existing headcount to adequately undertake and complete this complex and large scale exercise within the timescales required. It is also important to also emphasise that an organisation of the size of CQC would never seek to retain the level of capability and capacity to undertake a task of this scale and nature as it would not represent value for money to retain that skillset. Delivering the scale of change set out in the Strategy Implementation Plan from Q1 of 2017/18 means this work is critical to ensuring those changes are realised and more broadly the execution of CQC's strategy in the subsequent years.

The overarching contract will enable and support the development of CQCs target operating model by providing a mechanism and pool of specialist skills to be able to upscale CQCs small specialist teams to meet the change needs of the organisation.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,commercialcontracts@cqc.org.uk,"151 Buckingham Palace Road",Victoria,London,"SW1W 9SZ",England,,,"20170620 CQC PSO 109 Business Change Contract_Redacted v1.0.pdf ",,,12/06/2017,11/06/2018,09/03/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,300000,19/04/2017,300000,"[Atica Consulting Ltd|4 Sterling House, Sterling Road, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7RF|||No|No]",,12/06/2017,11/06/2018,"Other ",

The contract is for the provision of Support at Home services (domiciliary care) services in North East Lincolnshire for a 3 [three] year period with the possibility of extending for a further 2 years.

NELCCG are looking to award three Lead Provider contracts for designated geographical areas with support contracts awarded to Approved Providers to support the Lead Providers. 

NELCCG have been working to remodel the way people receive their support at home. Moving away from the rigid time/task method to a much more responsive, flexible and personal service. 

The aim will be to deliver, by developing responsive neighbourhood teams, outcome based, personalised support to individuals over the age of 18 residing in North East Lincolnshire who have social care needs and may also have health care needs, enabling them to remain in their own home and be supported to achieve and maintain their optimum potential for physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being.

While consistent routine calls will be required, the service will not be delivered on a time/task model but based on individual need, delivered in a responsive and flexible manner. 

A ""Team not Times"" approach with teams of support workers assigned to particular neighbourhoods has been developed. The Lead providers will assign support workers to neighbourhood areas within their geographical zones based on the needs of those receiving support in that area enabling workers to understand the needs of those individuals and to deliver support flexibly within that community.

Innovation and efficiencies in service provision for improved delivery of individual's outcomes will be sought from prospective providers of the service, as will enhanced partnership working to provide an integrated service that works across health, social care, voluntary and other agencies within North East Lincolnshire. 

It is likely TUPE will apply to the transfer of staff undertaking the current service provision; however, it will be the responsibility of bidders to seek appropriate legal advice at the appropriate time.

      The local Healthwatch Service within Warwickshire will be the independent consumer champion for the public to promote better outcomes in health and in social care - locally via Local Healthwatch organisations and nationally via Healthwatch England. 
      
      The local Healthwatch service in Warwickshire will be representative of the diverse communities it serves. It will provide intelligence - including evidence from people's views and experiences - to influence the policy, planning, commissioning and delivery of publicly-funded health and social care services. It will also provide information to help people access and make choices about services as well as provide signposting to those who wish to make a complaint about NHS services.
      
      The local Healthwatch service in Warwickshire will be a robust and credible player in the local health and social care economy by demonstrating that it has the appropriate level of skills and competencies required to deliver its statutory functions. It will gain the trust of the general public as well as other health and social care stakeholder groups and organisations by being responsive, acting on concerns when things go wrong and being able to constructively challenge health and social care commissioners and providers.
      
      The seven key functions of the local Healthwatch Service are:
      
      1. Gather views and experiences of patients and the public
      2. Make these views known, both locally and nationally as appropriate
      3. Promote and support involvement in commissioning of health services and provision of care services
      4. Recommend investigation or special review of services via Healthwatch England or directly to the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
      5. Provide advice and information about access to services and support for making informed choices

An emergency care benefit has been in place at the MRC since November 2014.   During this time uptake has increased as the scheme has become established and employees are more at ease with using the provision. The aim of the benefit is to allow employees to attend their workplace when they would have otherwise had to take time off when their normal care provision has broken down (for example, childminder is ill). This means that the provider must be able to quickly look at  an employee’s request and provide them with options.  Ultimately the employee will decide whether the options available to them are suitable. Due to the dispersed nature of the organisation the provider must have a good network of care options across the country that are reliable.
The MRC would seek to provide 6 ‘sessions’ of care provision in the first year but would like the flexibility to increase/decrease this as appropriate for the following year (to be agreed 3 months in advance).  This recognises that what defines a ‘session’ will depend on the type of care that has been requested by the employee and that the time spent at a nursery might be different to that of a child-minder.
The spend related to this contract will depend upon the amount of sessions required per employee.
MRC does not guarantee any employee usage of this contract .
The provider must be flexible, recognising that many instances of contact from employees will be in emergency situations when their normal care arrangements have broken down and will therefore need a quick turnaround and response.
Ability for employees to put forward their own care providers to be assessed and brought on board by the emergency provider.
Detailed data gathering practices for those who employees register to ensure accurate information is gathered in one place and then provided securely to the care provider when required.
Employees must be able to contact the provider to seek assistance and make emergency care arrangements outside of the standard working week (Monday – Friday; 9-5).  This must be at a minimum of between 7:30am – 7:00 pm
The online profile should show employees how many sessions they have used and how many they have remaining.
Employees should have the option of paying personally for the benefit once the MRC entitlement has been exhausted ( this will require the use of secure payment systems).
At a minimum the service must provide:
Emergency childcare (under 16), including: Nannies, Nursery, child-minders, School Holiday Cover, School holiday clubs, Adult care/ Elder care.
All childcare and adult care providers used by the supplier will be appropriately regulated, licensed, reference checked and accredited. All care agencies will be vetted by the Care Quality commission and/or the equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales",,,"Any region","55243000 85312000 ","PS16245 - MRC Emergency Care Provision",professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"North Star House","North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,"Bidder - Logging into Emptoris for the first time.docx PS16245 ITQ Invitation to Quote Questions .pdf PS16245 ITQ Invitation to Quote.pdf PS16245 AW5.2 Price Schedule.pdf ",,"How to Apply:

The DH Appointments Team manages the recruitment and selection process for Public Appointments that are made by the Secretary of State for Health. Ministers decide on whether or not to use executive search for these appointments and decisions are made on a case by case basis, dependent on the profile of the appointment and challenges to recruitment of a particular post. Our appointments include high profile Chair and Non-Executive Director appointments to DH’s Arms-Length Bodies, including for example, NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission. To ensure open competitions attract the very best candidates and a wide and diverse field of applicants and for some campaigns target specialist groups, there is sometimes a need to use executive search to support a campaign. The Department of Health is looking for an organisation to provide primarily, executive search support for key public appointments. Support may also be required for any other appointment for which Ministers have an interest and agree that search support from the DH contract may be used. The Department’s default position is not to use executive search when recruiting to public appointment. This also reflects the Government’s general view, and the Minister for the Cabinet Office (whose permission to use Executive Search is required) will only agree to the limited use of search. However, there are occasions when Ministers may, as part of the wider recruitment process, choose to use executive search support to strengthen the candidate field. This can be particularly important for key national roles, for certain specialist roles and for engaging with hard to reach groups, where even targeted advertising and use of social media can have limited effect. Search can be particularly effective in engaging with senior figures in the commercial/private sector and generally with those whose experience is out of the health and social care sector. The proposes Contract is expected to be for a period of up to 12 months, with two optional extension periods of up-to a further 12 months each. Please see attached  Procurement documents. DH reserves the right to not proceed to Contract for this requirement.",,,"Any region","79610000 79621000 79631000 79634000 79414000 ","Paul Eagleton",supplier.helpdesk@dh.gsi.gov.uk,"Quarry House, Quarry Hill",,Leeds,"LS2 7UE",England,,,"60207 T&Cs.pdf Exec Search one (a) tender template schedules Fin.docx Exec Search part A 60207 Fin.pdf Executive Search.pdf Participation Instructions.docx Schedule Two Pricing Schedule 60207 FIN.xlsx BMS e-tendering manual (v1.0 201112).pdf Exec Search part Part B 60207 Fin.docx ","https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health/about/procurement ","*Bids must be submitted via the BMS system as per Instructions*

The themes identified as having the most extensive and detrimental impact on individual and organisational well-being included:

•	Unsupportive leader/manager behaviour
•	Violence and aggression; internal and/or external behaviour

Key themes taken from the staff survey which the Trust is focusing on as identified in the survey include:

•	Tackling bullying and harassment
•	Protecting our staff from abuse

The Trust's most recent report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) identified:

•	There were allegations of bullying in some parts of the Trust.

Much work on improving the culture of the organisation has been undertaken to date to address the concerns of staff.

Several strategies have also been launched to provide support to staff and to identify what is required from the leaders within the Trust; Engagement Strategy, Leadership Strategy and Leadership Charter have been launched which align to the national NHS Healthcare Leadership Model, setting out the leadership behaviours we expect all of our leaders to demonstrate a Health and Well-being Strategy.

To further address the concerns raised in regard to bullying and harassment the Trust has produced an action plan and is looking for some elements of the plan to be provided from an external source.  These elements will be used and maintained by the Trust in the future.",,"MK41 0RG","East of England","80000000 ",,tenders@eastamb.nhs.uk,"Hammond Road",,Bedford,"MK41 0RG",England,,,,,"
