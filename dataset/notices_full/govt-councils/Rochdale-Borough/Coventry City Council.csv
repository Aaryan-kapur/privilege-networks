      The proposal is to project manage the delivery of the restoration of the Grade 1 Listed Joseph Paxton designed Arboretum Cemetery which is one of the top 5 Historic Cemeteries in the UK, as a visitor attraction, park for local people and education resource.

       To restore the Grade I listed heritage of national significance, which is not yet 'beyond repair'.
       To reinstate Paxton's original design, while this is still achievable, so that the LRC can function as a 'city park', as Paxton originally intended. Restoration includes work to the Promenade, a key feature of Paxton's early Victorian design.
       To find new uses for the Anglican Chapel, now that the cemetery is only rarely used for burials.
       To improve security by introducing new uses and by improvements to boundary security.
       To improve a local amenity in an area which rates low on the deprivation indices for environmental quality.
       To increase visitor numbers, both to the site and to Coventry, by restoring one of the country's top arboretum cemeteries and by linking in with other heritage attractions.
       To provide opportunities for training in traditional skills, working with the local college and building contractors.
       To provide visitor facilities on site which will enable its use by a much wider range of groups and for a greater variety of uses than is possible at present.
       To make a step change in education and understanding of the significance of the site with a much greater number and range of tours and information, in different formats, which will educate, inform and also entertain.

      The government launched the national NHS Test and Trace Service on 28th May 2020. This national service is designed to control the virus and enable people to live a safer and more normal life. The overarching guiding principles being Test; Trace; Contain; Enable. 
      The objective of this procurement is to ensure that swift and effective local provision of community testing is always available to support the multiagency SARS-CoV-2 outbreak response in Coventry and Warwickshire in non-health and care settings and to ensure capacity for prevalence testing (i.e. proactive testing) within specific communities/settings as required.
      The service will deliver this by delivering safe, consistent, equitable, and high-quality COVID-19 testing within defined settings and populations, timely transport of samples to laboratories, and - subject to which tests are used - communicating patient identifiable and aggregated data to key partners. The service will also deliver training and support to allied workers to increase testing capacity within the local system to be able to respond to multiple local outbreaks. 
      A sub-regional outbreak control plan for Coventry, Warwickshire, and Solihull has been developed (with individual local implementation plans), with eight key priorities; one of these priorities is identified as 'local testing capacity'. The local outbreak plan is available here.
      The local testing service will need to ensure a swift response that is accessible to the local population to support outbreak testing in non-health and care settings (which are supported through other routes), and for individuals who may not be able to access current testing sites/for whom home testing is not appropriate. 
      It is proposed that two service providers will be procured to deliver community testing (initially antigen testing via nose and throat swab) for outbreaks in non-health and care settings, and for individuals who cannot access testing via other means. Coventry City Council will lead the procurement and the service will operate across Coventry and Warwickshire. The service activity will be called off the contract alternating each provider as per requirement, with the highest scoring provider given first service referral.
      
      The providers will:
      Deliver testing sessions within particular venues/settings, e.g. schools and early years, workplaces, residential accommodation for homeless and vulnerable migrant communities (in outbreak scenario/as part of the proactive testing programme as required)

The new framework commencing 1 April 2018 will be accessible by the following participating Councils:

      o North Warwickshire Borough Council
      o Nuneaton & Bedworth Borough Council
      o Rugby Borough Council

      o Gloucestershire County Council and clients
      o Telford and Wrekin Council
      o Lincolnshire County Council and clients
      
      Warwickshire County Council is leading this procurement process on behalf of the other participating Councils.  Warwickshire County Council will be the contracting authority for the Internal Audit Services Framework Agreement.  
      
      The requirement is for internal auditing services, as defined by the Public Sector Internal Audit Standards, ie: Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organisation's operations.  It helps an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. 
      
      Internal audit services will comprise mainly internal ICT auditing services, including the development of ICT audit plans; risk assessments on ICT systems, equipment and services; undertaking audit reviews and reports; and providing advice to internal audit staff on ICT audit matters.   Additionally the contractor must have capacity for non ICT specialist work to provide additional audit resource if needed.
      As audit work will need to be carried out at a variety of locations, the framework will be divided into the following geographical lots:
      Lot 1 -  Warwickshire, Coventry, Solihull and Worcestershire
      Lot 2 -  Gloucestershire
      Lot 3 - Telford and Wrekin
      Lot 4 - Lincolnshire
      
      The services for each Lot will be delivered by one contractor.  There is no guarantee of business for any of the Lots.  Applicants are invited to bid for one or more of the lots.

This contract will be for circa £150k with the opportunity to for additional provision during the term of the project delivery which potentially runs to 2023, subject to funding. The total value of this contract will not exceed £180k.
      
      Housing First is a specific approach to ending homelessness for those with multiple and complex needs. It is aimed at people who are homeless/ at risk of being homeless, providing sustainable tenancies and providing choice-led support and access to services in order to sustain the tenancy. For more information see https://hfe.homeless.org.uk/
      
      Along with Liverpool and Greater Manchester the West Midlands is receiving government funding to pilot the Housing First approach to supporting vulnerable homeless people with multiple and complex needs. The West Midlands allocation is providing funding for Housing First to be delivered across the 7 Constituent Authorities within the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) areas: Birmingham City Council, Coventry City Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough, Solihull Metropolitan Borough, Walsall Council, City of Wolverhampton Council. 
      
      Each of the 7 Local Authorities in the pilot has a delegated resource to put in place local arrangements for delivery but there will be close joint working with the providers across the region. There is a regional project board and there will be an independent evaluation team working across the region to capture outcomes and learning and report back to the MHCLG. The board has decided that the Support Worker service provider will operate within the principles of a Psychologically Informed Environment (PIE) and have a PIE infrastructure in place. 
      
      Scope of the proposal 
      The frontline staff will be commissioned locally by the individual Local Authorities in the West Midlands. The PIE Training will be commissioned on behalf of the West Midlands Combined Authority. 
      
      The main frontline provision is the Support Worker role which will be a mix of Navigator (Lead Worker) or Peer Mentor, for more information see the quotation documentation. All support workers in the West Midlands Housing First Pilot will need to be PIE trained and receive a programme of 'reflective sessions' for 12 months.

- Sub Provision 1A - Primary data collection, utilising transport data collection companies for automatic traffic counts, manual surveys, video analysis and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth detection.
- Sub Provision 1B - Secondary data collection, purchase ad-hoc and licensed services from providers of mass movement data. 
- Sub Provision 2A- Software and Service Provider, consisting of software tools and a managed service supporting the software. Access to this platform will be available to the WMCA, TfWM, Local Authority Partners and others. The access will allow organisations to upload their own data as well read and download data from the system.
- Sub provision 2B - specialist consultancy utilising the tools to build custom workflows, manipulate complex data and provide ""data scientist"" skills to compliment the in-house data analyst team. This is to cover resource or skill capacity and to enable the upskilling of the internal team over time.

The framework will run for a maximum of 8 years with WMCA reserving the right to break the contract at year 4 and year 6. The reason behind the decision for an 8 year duration is that the provisions procured in this framework will support a future procurement (Transport Modelling) which is envisaged to be of equal length, for which a solid data collection and cataloguing are required. It is envisaged to appoint up to 5 suppliers per provision, however WMCA reserves the right to appoint a higher or lower number dependent on quality of submissions. Please note that the value is indicative as stated in the ITT documents.

-Additional Info - Primarily the incumbent supplier has been engaged to understand in detail how the existing contract is delivered. With regards to transport modelling there has been engagement with other bodies in the public sector to understand their approach. This has included Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council, the transport Systems Catapult and Highways England. 
The PIN notice 2016/S 189-338312 was published to OJEU on the 30 September 2016, and was intended to generate greater interest and lead to a supplier workshop to relay requirements and gather feedback prior to the contract notice in order to understand the ability of suppliers to meet the requirements. The supplier engagement day was held on the 18th November 2016 and attracted over 70 people from 45 companies. This was an early opportunity to present the intentions of the JDT re-let and gather feedback from the market about the approach we should take to deliver our aims and objectives at the right price in a competitive environment.The number of question received was considerable and the answers were broadcasted to all the suppliers along with the presentation files in a message sent via Bravo on the 01/12/2017, and subsequently on an individual basis to any suppliers who expressed a late interest in the open day.",,,"West Midlands","48613000 ",,procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,https://www.wmca.org.uk/,,"https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/esop/toolkit/opportunity/opportunityDetail.do?opportunityId=33142&oppList=CURRENT http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:334418-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:028965-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML ","This Framework is procured on behalf of WMCA Constituent Authorities (City of Birmingham Council, the City of Coventry Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Solihull Borough Council, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council and Wolverhampton Borough Council or any of them as the context shall require) who will not require a Joining Agreement to access the services of the framework.
