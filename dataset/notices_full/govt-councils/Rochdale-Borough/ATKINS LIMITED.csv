This work will be used to inform and influence the STEP project. STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) is the UK's study into the feasibility of building a power producing plant using nuclear fusion. 

The successful Consultant(s) will be selected by the Client to be members of a consortium that produces technological roadmaps that define key engineering technology areas that should be exploited on a 5-10 year timeframe. It should be noted that the Client is limited to an aggregated contract value of £140,000 and where possible it will be in the interest of the Client to select a balance of representations for the consortium. 

Engineering information is loosely defined as:
Information generated post concept design as a result of design progressing and maturing.
This information required is analogous to the information generated using a BIM approach.

Using BIM as a starting point the Client wishes to roadmap to future breakthrough use-age cases for both BIM and digital twinning. This work has a key interface with the Digital Engineering Strategy issued to market previously (T-VT066-19 - STEP WP1 - Production of Roadmap).

As a starting point, the Client has posed the following questions:
What might a breakthrough use case of BIM/IM look like for STEP?
What might a breakthrough use case of digital twinning look for STEP?

The output of this work will be used to inform: 
The STEP project and will influence the Digital Engineering Strategy.
The wider engineering endeavours of UKAEA in supporting fusion development.

Objectives 

The overall objective is to ensure that the DPC schemes are completed at best value for customers taking into account the costs of planning, design, construction and project management, recognising the scale and inherent risks of implementation of the schemes. Risk allocation and risk management are critical value issues within the commercial strategy and incentive structure.  


The Supplier will be required to work collaboratively with the various organisations engaged in the financing, implementation and regulation of DPC schemes and report effectively on the components which comprise the benefits, cost, risk and schedule which in combination will impact the customer value objective. 


The above objectives will require the Supplier to critically analyse and report on the scheme as a whole and with particular focus on Engineering and Project Management, Planning and Land Acquisition and Procurement.

At present there is not enough impartial information widely available to give the industry the confidence to widely increase the uptake of MMC. To remedy this Homes England is encouraging developers to commit to advanced levels of MMC on eight sites totalling almost 1,500 homes. As a condition of the development of this land we are mandating that the sites will have to be subject to research and performance monitoring to understand the benefits (and the potential draw backs) of delivering housing using different types of MMC technology.   
This study will provide a body of research which can answer the questions frequently asked by housebuilders, contractors, commissioners, financers, insurers, etc... as regards issues such as cost of delivery, the energy performance of MMC homes, the prevalence of delivery defects, material wastage levels, etc... by monitoring the projects from foundations through to one-year post occupancy.  
This data and analysis needs to be in a format that can be readily shared with industry, local & national government and other interested parties to provide clear evidence on how MMC performs against traditional build.  It is intended that this landmark study provides a template for how the industry and other partners can measure the performance of MMC in the future, creating a substantial body of data and encouraging the uptake of MMC more widely.

Ensuring UK innovators capitalise on the opportunities presented by the energy system transformation is an essential strand of the ESC's mission. SMEs in particular, face a range of systemic challenges and barriers to get new energy-related products and services to market and ready for wide-scale adoption by customers.  At the same time SMEs must contend with the start-up, growth and scale-up challenges many new businesses struggle with, regardless of sector.  
Our response for supporting innovative SME's is to offer a combined solution.   We offer help to refine propositions and open routes to market through applying ESC assets and capabilities to navigate the energy transformation and systemic barriers to market entry.  In parallel, we combine this offering with tailored business growth assistance through access to a broad network of market, technology, and business domain experts, existing incubators, accelerators and external support initiatives. 
This gives rise to the ISP vision, that aligns with the ESC's 5-year Delivery Plan:  ""To establish the UK's leading 'virtual' energy incubator, supporting innovators to open routes to market whilst helping them to tackle business growth challenges""
We are delivering this vision through a 3-tier platform that can offer SME's a journey through Universal support, Incubation and Acceleration that suits their needs and stage of business:

- Sub Provision 1A - Primary data collection, utilising transport data collection companies for automatic traffic counts, manual surveys, video analysis and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth detection.
- Sub Provision 1B - Secondary data collection, purchase ad-hoc and licensed services from providers of mass movement data. 
- Sub Provision 2A- Software and Service Provider, consisting of software tools and a managed service supporting the software. Access to this platform will be available to the WMCA, TfWM, Local Authority Partners and others. The access will allow organisations to upload their own data as well read and download data from the system.
- Sub provision 2B - specialist consultancy utilising the tools to build custom workflows, manipulate complex data and provide ""data scientist"" skills to compliment the in-house data analyst team. This is to cover resource or skill capacity and to enable the upskilling of the internal team over time.

The framework will run for a maximum of 8 years with WMCA reserving the right to break the contract at year 4 and year 6. The reason behind the decision for an 8 year duration is that the provisions procured in this framework will support a future procurement (Transport Modelling) which is envisaged to be of equal length, for which a solid data collection and cataloguing are required. It is envisaged to appoint up to 5 suppliers per provision, however WMCA reserves the right to appoint a higher or lower number dependent on quality of submissions. Please note that the value is indicative as stated in the ITT documents.

-Additional Info - Primarily the incumbent supplier has been engaged to understand in detail how the existing contract is delivered. With regards to transport modelling there has been engagement with other bodies in the public sector to understand their approach. This has included Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council, the transport Systems Catapult and Highways England. 
The PIN notice 2016/S 189-338312 was published to OJEU on the 30 September 2016, and was intended to generate greater interest and lead to a supplier workshop to relay requirements and gather feedback prior to the contract notice in order to understand the ability of suppliers to meet the requirements. The supplier engagement day was held on the 18th November 2016 and attracted over 70 people from 45 companies. This was an early opportunity to present the intentions of the JDT re-let and gather feedback from the market about the approach we should take to deliver our aims and objectives at the right price in a competitive environment.The number of question received was considerable and the answers were broadcasted to all the suppliers along with the presentation files in a message sent via Bravo on the 01/12/2017, and subsequently on an individual basis to any suppliers who expressed a late interest in the open day.",,,"West Midlands","48613000 ",,procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,https://www.wmca.org.uk/,,"https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/esop/toolkit/opportunity/opportunityDetail.do?opportunityId=33142&oppList=CURRENT http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:334418-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:028965-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML ","This Framework is procured on behalf of WMCA Constituent Authorities (City of Birmingham Council, the City of Coventry Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Solihull Borough Council, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council and Wolverhampton Borough Council or any of them as the context shall require) who will not require a Joining Agreement to access the services of the framework.

This project is a first step to understanding the role technology already plays at local level in terms of existing transport schemes 'on the ground' and those already planned. 
The deployment of emerging ITS technologies is often considered to be patchy, problem led, with the benefits unproven. The aim of this research is to understand the role of technology in existing and planned local transport schemes both in England and at the European and international level. It will, for example, identify the contribution ITS currently provides to delivering urban mobility and supporting the Smart City concept in English towns and cities.
Acknowledging the current financial constraints, the project will explore the barriers to future adoption at a local level - both actual and perceived - and make recommendations for future ways of working and sharing information/project experience/assessment and evaluation tools.

Port of Liverpool HGV Parking Site Identification Study","On behalf of the Liverpool City Region (LCR) Port Access Steering Group, Sefton Council is seeking quotations for consultancy support to complete a Port of Liverpool HGV Parking Site Identification Study. The Port Access Steering Group reports to the LCR Cabinet and Local Enterprise Partnership and is seeking to address a key City Region concern to improve accessibility to the Port. The Study will be part funded by the European Union through the Atlantis Connecting Europe Facility project.      

Background to the Project

The HGV Parking Site Identification Study will build on a HGV Port related Parking Demand Study which reported in January 2016 and assessed parking demand in 2015 and for future years 2020, 2025 and 2030. The study took into account the expected increase in Port traffic, changes in its nature and the introduction of controls (such as a booking-in system) to manage the traffic in and out of the Port estate. A further output from this initial study was a long list of possible sites for HGV Parking based on a high level assessment of a number of broad criteria. The outputs from the Parking Demand Study now need refinement in terms of assessment of demand and site identification.

1276,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION",Awarded,2015-08-27T21:08:18Z,"Eligibility Checking System","The Eligibility Checking System (ECS) is a tool offered to local authorities to assist them in identifying who is entitled to specified educational benefits. The system provides simple yes/no answers to enquiries as to whether a family is entitled. Although it was originally designed to check free school meal (FSM) entitlement, the system has recently been extended to enable local authorities to use the ECS to also check eligibility for the early learning for two-year-olds entitlement and Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP).

The introduction of Universal Credit (UC) – which will replace most of the benefits currently used to give entitlement – means that we need to change the eligibility criteria for FSM, EYPP and early learning for two-year-olds.

In turn this will mean that the ECS will require development to accommodate these new eligibility criteria, and will need to be tested against the new DWP UC IT system to ensure systems continue to interface correctly. It will also need to retain functionality to check eligibility against current (legacy) benefits until full roll-out of UC is achieved.

Start and end dates of the contract: October 2015 to December 2016 (with an option to extend for a further one year).",,,"Any region","72000000 ","David Greedus",david.greedus@education.gsi.gov.uk,"Department for Education, 2nd Floor, Piccadilly Gate, Store Street",,Manchester,"M1 2WD",England,"0161 600 1338",www.education.gov.uk,"1276 Eligibility Checking System Invitation to tender letter FINAL.doc 1276 Eligibility Checking System Technical Overview.docx 1276 Eligibility Checking System Q&A.16.9.2015.docx ",,,05/10/2015,25/11/2016,25/09/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,400000,650000,15/12/2015,779989.5,"[Atkins Limited|Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey KT18 5BW|||No|No]",,06/11/2015,30/12/2016,"Open ",
