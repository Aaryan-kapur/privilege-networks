The Police and Crime Commissioners Police and Crime Plan sets clear objectives to ensure victims are at the heart of what we do. To support this, the PCC for Essex has adopted a set of principles to deliver the objectives set out in the plan;

* We believe Victims should be at the heart of the Criminal Justice System and are placing a special emphasis on their needs within each and every policing priority
* Every Victim should receive the services they are entitled to under the Victims Code and we will ensure that the criminal justice agencies are held to account for delivery against this code
* Everyone who reports a crime should be kept informed and updated about their case
* People who have experienced harm should receive appropriate support and be directly involved in the design of their services
* We will commission services which are driven by the needs of the victim and we will regularly seek feedback to improve and provide even better support, so victims are able to cope and recover from their experience
* Our Restorative Justice Services, which are focused on the needs of the victims, will expand to enable more victims to have access

The primary aim of this service is to ensure that people are supported to cope and recover after being victims of crime and increase levels of victim satisfaction.

Expected additional outcomes for this service are: 

* Contribution to victims having a more positive experience of the criminal justice system
* Feedback is gathered from victims that contribute to improvements within the service and to other partners including but not limited to Essex Police and OPCC.
* Victims are helped to move towards positive outcomes - in line with the 8 categories identified in the Victim's Code
* Victims feel equipped and empowered to move on independently of the service
* Victims are supported to help reduce the risk of repeat victimisation
* Victims report improvements to their presenting problem(s)

Through the Safeguarding VCS Grant Programme we want to help develop and further our strategic aims to safeguard and protect children. We are making available up to a maximum of £2.25 million in safeguarding grant funding to VCS organisations for an 18-month period (October 2016- March 2018) to help deliver on three safeguarding priorities: 
-	Female Genital Mutilation (FGM); 
-	Radicalisation; and 
-	Domestic abuse, drugs and alcohol misuse.

A number of grants will be awarded in each of these three priority areas. VCS organisations may submit bids related to one or more safeguarding priority.  A separate application form must be completed for each priority area. 

The exact number and size of individual grants will depend on the range and quality of bids received. There is no specific minimum or maximum amount of grant award. As an indicative guide for bidders, and reflecting the national focus of this grant opportunity, we would expect grant awards to be in the region of £100,000 to £250,000 for each financial year, apportioned accordingly.

We are targeting these forms of abuse to help address gaps in the market; provide support to service delivery given increased prevalence; or to further support or embed Government reforms.     
The successful bidders will deliver activities in support of one or more of the above safeguarding priorities. The projects that we fund will aim to safeguard children from these forms of abuse through supporting prevention, raising awareness and providing advice, support and guidance.

Applications will be assessed and prioritised according to the extent to which they meet the assessment criteria described in the application form. 

Any questions related to points of clarification, or process must be submitted by noon 14 July to: Enquiries.SAFEGUARDING@education.gsi.gov.uk

The grant period will be for 18 months - 1 October 2016 - 31 March 2018. There is potential to extend for a further six months (April 2018 to October 2018) - subject to funding being available.

The value of the grants will be between £100,000 - £250,000 pa (pro-rated for 2016-17) per grant award.

Becoming a victim or indeed witness of crime or high level anti-social behaviour can have a significant physical, emotional and financial impact. The Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner is seeking to award 2 lots in relation to the support of victims and witnesses (hereafter referred to as ""victims"" for brevity) of crime in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR).

Lot 1 - Victim First.
Whilst police officers are able to give some support to victims as part of their broader role, specialist support is required to fully enable victims to cope and recover from the impact that the crime has had on them. The Victim First service is intended to be the primary service across LLR that provides this cope and recovery support (including restorative justice) to enable victims to move on positively with their lives.

The service will be based within the community, providing cope and recovery services throughout the victim journey (from reporting of crime through to any court appearances, restorative justice and release of offender).

Victim First has been in existence since October 2015 and has established itself as a strong brand across LLR.  The provider of the Victim First service will continue to use the Victim First brand and will be expected to grow its presence, awareness and reputation across LLR.  This service (Victim First (2018)) will build on the existing service with expansion of provision to young people, increasing access to support and a greater community presence across LLR.

The service is being commissioned by the Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner who is, in part, making use of Victims Grant funding from the Ministry of Justice.  The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) are currently consulting on the potential of devolving further specialist victim services (such as the court based witness service).  This contract is being set up in such a way that, should these further services be devolved within the life of this contract, they can be added to this contract by way of a mutually developed/agreed contract variation.

Lot 2 - Target Hardening
The Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner is commissioning a Victim First service (Lot 1) and currently co-commissions with local authorities an information and support service for victims of sexual and/or domestic abuse/violence. The Target Hardening service will exclusively receive referrals from these two victim support services to provide a home security service to victims of crime living in LLR.

The service will, in a timely manner, undertake home security checks and advice as well as providing and fitting (where fitting is required) products which will enhance the security of the home.

The contract period is from 1st August 2018 to 31st July 2021 with an option to extend for a further two year period.",,,"East Midlands","35121300 75200000 98000000 98133100 ",Procurement,procurement@leicestershire.pnn.police.uk,"Police Headquarters, St. Johns, Enderby",,Leicestershire,"LE19 2BX",ENG,"+44 1162222222",www.leics.police.uk,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=21169&B=BLUELIGHT https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/30501 ",,01/08/2018,31/07/2021,12/02/2018,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,450000,2779484,02/05/2018,3229484,"[C22 Ltd t/a Catch 22|8 Laurence Pountney Hill, London, EC4R 0BE|NONE||No|No][24-7 Locks Ltd|Unit 3 Middleway Industrial Estate, 255 Moseley Road, Birmingham, B12 0EA|NONE||No|No]",,01/08/2018,31/07/2021,"Open ",

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire (""the PCC"") has a wide remit to cut crime, improve community safety and support victims of crime in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.
