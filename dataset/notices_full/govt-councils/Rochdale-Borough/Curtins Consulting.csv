The University of Sheffield is looking for suitably qualified and competent persons to undertake this work

The project is for the building of a covered storage facility with crane capacity of 50 Tonne. This is the ideal solution although a lower rating of crane may be acceptable if 50 Tonne is not possible due to site conditions and ground bearing capacities.
 
The objective is to provide a facility on a location on the Nuclear AMRC site that can store tests piece, materials and equipment to a weight of 50 Tonne. A feasibility study is required to determine the optimum location considering logistics of handling large items and budget constraints.  There are two site locations which would be suitable but each with different ground bearing capacities and access issues.

The project for which you are bidding will comprise a c300sm single storey storage facility either as an extension to the existing NAMRC building or a stand alone unit adjacent to the existing HGV access road.
