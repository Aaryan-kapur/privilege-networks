Services being procured are Chest surgery (trans masculine), Genital surgery (trans feminine) and Genital surgery (trans masculine).

The Services will be available to individuals eligible for NHS-funded care who are ordinarily resident in England, Scotland or Wales - or otherwise who are the commissioning responsibility of the NHS in England, Scotland or Wales - and who meet the eligibility criteria described in the Service Specification. Successful Bidders will hold a single contract with NHS England for services provided to eligible patients who are the commissioning responsibility of NHS England, NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.

The NHS pathway of care for adults with gender dysphoria will differ according to the individual's goals. The envisaged adult pathway may typically be summarised as: 

•	Referral to a specialist Gender Dysphoria Clinic 
•	Assessment for gender dysphoria, and diagnosis
•	Individuals who meet the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria are accepted on to the NHS care pathway and an individual treatment plan is agreed between the individual and their lead clinician in the Gender Dysphoria Clinic
•	Certain therapeutic interventions are delivered by the Gender Dysphoria Clinic; and / or referral for interventions with other providers; which may include recommendations to primary care for prescribing endocrine treatments
•	Gender Dysphoria Clinic makes a referral for surgical interventions of the chest and genitals if criteria are met via a planned National Referral Support Service
•	Ongoing review and monitoring during and after interventions
•	Conclusion of contact: discharge to primary care

Contracts will be for an initial term of 5 years with a possible extension of any period up to a further 2 years as defined and at the discretion of the Commissioner.

The approach for improving the surgical market is focused on establishing a flexible contract that facilitates patient choice based on a consideration of reliable data including new quality indicators. No volumes are guaranteed on the award of a contract.
