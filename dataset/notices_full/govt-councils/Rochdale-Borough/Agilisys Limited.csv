The incumbent supplier provides all ICT managed services on an aggregated basis.  In this re-procurement of services the Authority is following a disaggregated model.  The new overarching target operating model (""TOM""), of which this contract for managed infrastructure services forms a part, is designed to enhance internal systems and service integration capabilities by replacing the single supplier ICT managed services with services provided by a  mix of in-house and external suppliers.

This contract award notice relates to a contract for the design, implementation and maintenance of the centralised and distributed platforms and infrastructure services needed to support the Authority's in-scope business applications.  The centralised platforms and infrastructure services for these will be designed and built within the data centres by the managed infrastructure supplier; followed by a cutover of data and applications from the incumbent data centres.  Infrastructure services hosted on the Authority's sites will be transitioned to the new supplier via a 'walk in, takeover' approach.  This service will also include cloud brokerage where applications are able to be cloud hosted and so reduce the footprint of the residual ""on-premise"" data centre estate.

The contract is in the form of a tailored version of the Crown Commercial Service's Model services Agreement.  The TOM involves a move away from dependency on a single prime supplier to a multi-supplier environment with suppliers being onboarded, offboarded and managed by the Authority under service integration and management function arrangements.  Collaboration and cooperation across the supplier base is critical to the success of the TOM in that end-to-end service delivery can only be achieved where the key suppliers are working together collaboratively.  Each supplier's ability to perform the services and meet service levels is in part dependent on one or more of the other suppliers and this has been recognised in the contract with the inclusion of collaboration principles, seeking to enable a coordinated approach to ensure the seamless, continuous, effective, timely and proper delivery of services.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and the Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West","72000000 ","Sean  Murphy",sean.murphy4@nhs.net,"Stella House, Goldcrest Way, Newburn Riverside Business Park",,"Newcastle upon Tyne","NE15 8NY",England,"0191 2035068",,,,"
