The council requires that the portfolio is managed to produce the maximum financial benefit to the council, in a commercial and professional manner.  At the same time the Service Provider will need to be balance this approach with the objectives of promoting social, environmental and economic well being as set out in the Corporate Plan and the Corporate Property Strategy and Asset Management Plan and other relevant council plans and policies.
      
      This framework agreement is in two Lots, split as (i) Commercial portfolio and (ii) Agricultural portfolio and will start 02 April 2018 and will run for four years, ending 31 March 2022.  
      
      From 01 April 2017 the Council became a founding partner of Orbis, a Public Sector Partnership between the Council, East Sussex County Council and Surrey County Council. The partnership was formed to:
      o drive efficiencies through increased standardisation and removal of duplication 
      o pool resources, expertise and knowledge to identify best practice approaches that best meet the need of our customers
      o create greater operational resilience
      o deliver greater value for money, placing customers at the heart of everything that we do
      o improve accessibility of services to the customer through a self-sufficiency approach 
      In the spirit of the partnership therefore, East Sussex County Council and Surrey County Council will be able to call-off this framework agreement. This will mainly occur when their existing estate manager is unable to fulfil the requirement.  The Council will act as Framework Agreement Administrator and each participating public body will manage their own requirement.",,"BN1 1JE","South East","70330000 70300000 70332100 70000000 70332200 ","Jessica Hamilton (BHCC)",jessica.hamilton@brighton-hove.gov.uk,"Bartholomew Square",Brighton,UK,"BN1 1JE","United Kingdom",01273291461,https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk,,,,02/04/2018,31/03/2022,23/11/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,13/02/2018,0,"[GVA Grimley Limited|3 Brindleyplace, Birmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom, B73 6PN|NONE||No|No][Savills (UK) ltd|33 Margaret Street, London, United Kingdom, W1G 0JD|NONE||No|No]","Public Sector",02/04/2018,31/03/2022,"Open ",
