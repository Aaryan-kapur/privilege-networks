NRW/PLG/9714/B,Contract,"Norwich City Council e-Tendering",Awarded,2018-02-07T09:47:42Z,"9714 - Improvements to the play area and associated works at Mile Cross gardens in Norwich","Mile Cross Gardens are grade II listed parks; they are an integral feature of the Mile Cross housing development. The two linked parks were designed in the 1920s to provide green space and recreational opportunities for residents. They were originally laid out as bowling greens and each park has a classical pavilion building that served as the bowl pavilion.
       
      This project covers improving the condition of the gardens along with improving the play value of the green space and enhancing access to the sites for visitors / users. 
      In recent years the parks have become underused and the fabric of the original design including pergola features, stone walling and the original pavilion buildings have either been removed (in the case of the pergolas) or damaged and becoming costly and difficult to maintain. There are limited play facilities (play equipment) in the northern of the two parks. The simple layout and style of the parks has ensured that they remain an attractive asset to the area but investment is required to ensure they continue to serve the needs of the local community.
      
      Norwich City Council is seeking a supplier to complete the required improvements and associated works. 
      This project proposal is for the:-
      • removal of two swing sets 
      •supply and installation of new play equipment 
      •installation of seating and picnic benches
      •replacement access steps 
      •installation of a new access gate 
      •slimblock grass grid to damaged grass surfacing
      •preparing the site for installation of safety surfacing by DCM surfacing.
      
      The Gardens are adjacent to and accessible from Suckling Avenue, Mile Cross, Norwich NR3 2RS.",,"NR2 1NH","East of England","45000000 45213316 71421000 ","Gillian Newton",gilliannewton@norwich.gov.uk,"City Hall","St Peters Street",Norwich,"NR2 1NH","United Kingdom","01603 212169",http://www.norwich.gov.uk/YourCouncil/Finance/Pages/Procurement.aspx,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/norwich/aspx/ ","Please download tender documents and upload completed tenders using the link:
