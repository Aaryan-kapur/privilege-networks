Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council is committed to the provision of high quality services to enable people to live in their own homes.

Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (Adult Services), are inviting expressions of interest in the above tender, this is an open tender previously advertised in OJEU since 27 July 2017.

The contract is for a period of five years and will commence 1 November 2017.
Direct Payments are an alternative to traditional care and support services.  The Council provides cash payments for individual Service Users to purchase services that meet their assessed care needs.  This gives the person receiving services more choice and control over how their care needs are met.  Recipients of Direct Payments can choose to employ their own care workers known as Personal Assistants (PAs) or to buy services from a provider or a mixture of the two.   
In providing Direct Payments, local authorities are also expected to provide a service to support those who need assistance in managing their Direct Payments. 

We are looking for providers to deliver all of the following :-

A.	Standard Payroll service
B.	Managed Accounts service with Payroll
C.	Managed Accounts service without Payroll

NB - The Council MAY be implementing payment cards to help Service Users manage funds and this may reduce the need for Managed Accounts Services in the future. This will be coordinated with the successful provider and the contract amount specific to managed accounts will at this point be excluded from the contract.
The current level of service is; 

255 Service Users in Total of these -
102 Managed Accounts with Payroll
39 Invoice only Managed Accounts (managed accounts without payroll)
114 Standard Accounts

327 Payslips per month 

These figures may fluctuate but the provider will be expected to manage the fluctuation within the total budget. If the fluctuations are consistently either increasing or decreasing over a period of time this will be reviewed with the successful provider. 

The maximum first year budget is £65,000 (Please note that any tendering organisation submitting a first year contract price greater than this will not have their tender considered)

For further information or to express an interest full details can be found on the CHEST North West procurement portal https://www.the-chest.org.uk/ 

The proposal incorporates 2 elements.

•	Firstly enabling access to crisis support for one of the most excluded groups i.e. for women affected by domestic abuse and with no recourse to public funds. 
•	Secondly providing access direct into permanent homes for households experiencing severe and multiple disadvantage.  

This proposal is an exciting opportunity to provide an effective service for those who are victims of domestic violence and abuse and coping with multiple disadvantages. This service will act on a model of 'Housing First' accommodation and support.  It will ensure we are directing services to establish lasting independence, housing victims of domestic violence and abuse and their families in a community, rather than a temporary refuge, and wrapping around specialist and intensive support. This type of provision is not currently available in any of our boroughs on a housing first basis.  

The defined cohort places a high cost on criminal justice and health services. This approach will bring transformational change to the way that we commission services to respond to domestic violence and abuse across the 3 authorities. 

The purpose of this Service is to integrate the functions and services that are required to support victims of domestic abuse and navigate through their needs using both the Service and the network of other existing services and help that is available to allow the client to become independent.

This contract is planned to run for a period of 1 year commencing in Autumn 2017.
The value of the contract is £193,000.

The service will provide support to Service Users ordinarily resident in the borough.
The service will utilise a single building, Wilshaw House, Ashton-under-Lyne, in delivering that part of the service that is required to be building-based. Wilshaw House is owned and maintained by the commissioner and other local authority functions may take place elsewhere within the buildings. There is no expectation that the Provider will be charged rent
	
While part of the service will be building-based, there will also be flexible and responsive person-centred support for Service Users to access and engage with external mainstream and community facilities.

This could be either in small groups or as individual integrated activities, wherever this is possible or practicable.
The Provider will provide up to 140 building-based places per week as an indicative figure. Other Service Users will be supported to utilise a community day service element that would provide an additional eight day places, seven days a week, ie another 56 weekly places, giving a combined total of 196 places a week. 
As a consequence of the severity and progress of their dementia, some Service Users are likely to require assistance with aspects of personal care.
The Provider will need to make provision for the arrangement of the safe and reliable transport of Service Users to and from the Service, where Service Users require it. The catchment area could include any part of the borough. Transport may require the use of a mini bus or mini buses of a number to be agreed, which the Provider will be responsible for providing and maintaining. Support Staff will drive and act as escort on these buses. 
Meals make a major contribution to Service Users' participation in and enjoyment of daily living routines. Mealtimes are recognised as an important social occasion, as well as being an important and necessary element in the routine of some Service Users. The Provider will ensure that meals are available to all Service Users on a flexible basis. For example, some Service Users will prefer a hot, lunchtime meal as their choice.
