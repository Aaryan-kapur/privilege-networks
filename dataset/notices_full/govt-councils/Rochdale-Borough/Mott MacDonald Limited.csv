for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Secretary of State”), the Water Services Regulation Authority (“Regulator”) and Bazalgette Tunnel Limited (who has been independently procured as the Infrastructure Provider for the delivery of the Project (“IP”). 

The contract is for an Initial Term (Initial ITA Term) of four years with an option to extend for up to three further periods each of four years (Additional ITA Term) making a total possible aggregate term of sixteen years.
This procurement is part of a series of procurements in relation to the Project which will modernise London’s sewerage system, delivering environmental and economic benefits to the UK’s capital for generations. Amajor new sewer, the “Thames Tideway Tunnel”, is urgently needed to provide the necessary additional sewer capacity to protect the River Thames from increasing pollution. It will help tackle the problem of the capital’s Victorian sewers overflowing into the River Thames and enable the UK to meet European environmental standards. The Thames Tideway Tunnel will run to approximately 25 km long and up to 70 m deep underground (requiring excavation), broadly following the River Thames and will connect with Thames Water’s existing sewer network.  Project oversight is to be maintained by establishing a Liaison Committee comprising representatives appointed by each of the Secretary of State, Thames Water and the IP. This Liaison Committee is governed by the Liaison Agreement entered into by all three parties. The size, complexity and risk of the Project is such that the Liaison Agreement requires that an Independent Technical Assessor (ITA) is appointed. The detailed Services are described in the ITA Deed and were described in the procurement documents but the overarching role and purpose of the ITA is to objectively and independently review, evaluate, comment, verify and advise the parties to the Liaison Agreement and the Regulator on the IP and Thames Water’s assessment of ongoing Project performance and delivery. The ITA will advise and have a duty of care to the Regulator and the parties to the Liaison Agreement. These obligations and the nature of the duty of care are as set out in the ITA Deed which has been entered into between the ITA, the three parties to the Liaison Agreement and the Regulator.  The ITA Deed was entered into on award of the Project Licence to Bazalgette Tunnel Limited on 24 August 2015.",,,London,"71311000 ","Phil Prout",Phil.Prout@tidewaytunnels.co.uk,"The Point, 37 North Wharf Road,",Paddington,London,"W2 1AF",England,,,,,,24/08/2015,23/08/2031,24/08/2015,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,12312112.73,,24/08/2015,12312112.73,"[Mott Macdonald Limited|Mott Macdonald House

The new system is:
•	replacing statements of SEN and learning disability assessments with Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans - setting out in one place all the support families will receive;
•	requiring councils to publish a 'local offer' showing the support available in the area to all children and young people who have disabilities or SEN;
•	requiring better co-operation between councils and health services to make sure services for children and young people with SEN and disabilities are jointly planned and commissioned;
•	giving parents and young people with EHC plans the offer of a personal budget;
•	introducing mediation for disputes; and 
•	introducing a legal right for children and young people with an EHC plan to express a preference for state academies, free schools and further education colleges.

On 26 January 2016, the Children's Minister Edward Timpson, announced a package of additional support for implementation of the SEND reforms in England during 2016-17.  This included: 
o	£35.8 million in implementation funding for local authorities in 2016 to 2017, recognising the additional duties placed on them as a result of the transition to EHC plans 
o	£27.3 million for the Family Fund Trust to support low income families with disabled children 
o	£15 million to fund the independent supporters programme, helping to support families and young people to navigate the system, and creating positive experiences for them 
o	£2.3 million for Parent Carer Forums, which bring parents together to provide invaluable support and advice for families.

To complement this programme of delivery support, the Government is now seeking applications for a new contract in 2017-18 to support local areas in embedding the SEND reforms.  
Some of the key requirements for the contract are provided at Annex A.  Further information is contained within the Invitation to Tender documentation.

RD1001203,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION",Awarded,2018-03-19T09:49:18Z,"To manage the Adoption Support Fund (ASF)","The Adoption Support Fund (ASF) was introduced in May 2015 to enable adoptive families to have access to specialist therapeutic support services when they need them so as to improve outcomes for young people and families. In April 2016, the scope of the Fund was extended to children who were previously in care immediately prior to being cared for under a Special Guardianship Order (SGO) and children living in England who were adopted from countries other than England.

Adoption support services play a vital role in supporting families to meet the needs of their adoptive children.  Over 70% of children adopted enter care due to abuse or neglect. Many adopted children have specific needs or disabilities, which require additional support. While recent research has shown that only around 3% of adoptions disrupt, a quarter of parents report major challenges, and a further third describe life as generally good with some challenge. 

The Adoption and Children Act (2002) places a duty on local authorities to maintain an appropriate service for adoption support. The Adoption Support Services Regulations (2005) require authorities to assess adoption support needs when requested by an adoptive child, their parents, natural parents and former guardians. The provision of support to meet these needs is at the discretion of the local authority, taking into account the individual case and local resources. 

Despite the increase in funding to local authorities through the ASF, we are aware that there still remain challenges around adoption support services e.g. parental awareness of entitlement to an assessment of their adoption support needs; the timeliness and quality of adoption support assessments; an underdeveloped evidence base on the effectiveness of specialist therapeutic interventions and availability and quality of services across the country.
To access the ASF, the responsible local authority must have conducted an assessment of the adoptive/eligible special guardian family's support needs. If the assessment identifies that therapeutic services would be beneficial to the family, the local authority, in discussion with the family, can apply to the ASF on the family's behalf.",,,"Any region","66000000 ",,amy.cotton@education.gov.uk,"2 St Paul's Place, 125 Norfolk Street,",,"Sheffield,","S1 2FJ",England,,,"691 To manage the Adoption Support Fund (ASF).contract.pdf 691 ASF Contract 2018-2020 - Annex 1.docx ",,,06/02/2018,31/03/2020,04/12/2017,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,4798668,,21/12/2017,4798668,"[Mott MacDonald Limited|Mott MacDonald House

- Sub provision 2B - specialist consultancy utilising the tools to build custom workflows, manipulate complex data and provide ""data scientist"" skills to compliment the in-house data analyst team. This is to cover resource or skill capacity and to enable the upskilling of the internal team over time.

The framework will run for a maximum of 8 years with WMCA reserving the right to break the contract at year 4 and year 6. The reason behind the decision for an 8 year duration is that the provisions procured in this framework will support a future procurement (Transport Modelling) which is envisaged to be of equal length, for which a solid data collection and cataloguing are required. It is envisaged to appoint up to 5 suppliers per provision, however WMCA reserves the right to appoint a higher or lower number dependent on quality of submissions. Please note that the value is indicative as stated in the ITT documents.

-Additional Info - Primarily the incumbent supplier has been engaged to understand in detail how the existing contract is delivered. With regards to transport modelling there has been engagement with other bodies in the public sector to understand their approach. This has included Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council, the transport Systems Catapult and Highways England. 
The PIN notice 2016/S 189-338312 was published to OJEU on the 30 September 2016, and was intended to generate greater interest and lead to a supplier workshop to relay requirements and gather feedback prior to the contract notice in order to understand the ability of suppliers to meet the requirements. The supplier engagement day was held on the 18th November 2016 and attracted over 70 people from 45 companies. This was an early opportunity to present the intentions of the JDT re-let and gather feedback from the market about the approach we should take to deliver our aims and objectives at the right price in a competitive environment.The number of question received was considerable and the answers were broadcasted to all the suppliers along with the presentation files in a message sent via Bravo on the 01/12/2017, and subsequently on an individual basis to any suppliers who expressed a late interest in the open day.",,,"West Midlands","48613000 ",,procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,https://www.wmca.org.uk/,,"https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/esop/toolkit/opportunity/opportunityDetail.do?opportunityId=33142&oppList=CURRENT http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:334418-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:028965-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML ","This Framework is procured on behalf of WMCA Constituent Authorities (City of Birmingham Council, the City of Coventry Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Solihull Borough Council, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council and Wolverhampton Borough Council or any of them as the context shall require) who will not require a Joining Agreement to access the services of the framework.

The works will be MEP biased with supporting works such as builders work, air flow analysis and rectification, containment sealability assessment and rectification, provisions of fixtures and fittings etc. as required to support the MEP works. A key component of Lot 1 will be capability to support testing, commissioning and validation of newly installed equipment or functions within a high level (CL3 and CL4 (only used for SAPO4 - no ACDP4)) containment environment, although work may be requested in any form of containment facility.
 Providers will have prior experience of working within a high level containment environment. It is anticipated that the majority of works required will be in SAPO3/ACDP3 environments but there will also be works required in SAPO4. 
 Providers will need to demonstrate capability to provide services through a supply chain, including project management. 
 In all cases however, if work is awarded under this lot, it is the responsibility of the provider to manage the supply chain, even if the provider chooses to use providers from other lots. You will take full responsibility for all sub-contractors and act as principal contractor under the CDM Regulations, unless otherwise notified.
 The works undertaken within Lot 1 will be subject to SWIFT, Hazop, LOPA, establishment of SIL ratings and other analysis as required under BS EN 61511 where they create or change a safety function.

This work will be used to inform and influence the STEP project. STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) is the UK's study into the feasibility of building a power producing plant using nuclear fusion. 

The successful Consultant(s) will be selected by the Client to be members of a consortium that produces technological roadmaps that define key engineering technology areas that should be exploited on a 5-10 year timeframe. It should be noted that the Client is limited to an aggregated contract value of £140,000 and where possible it will be in the interest of the Client to select a balance of representations for the consortium. 

Engineering information is loosely defined as:
Information generated post concept design as a result of design progressing and maturing.
This information required is analogous to the information generated using a BIM approach.

Using BIM as a starting point the Client wishes to roadmap to future breakthrough use-age cases for both BIM and digital twinning. This work has a key interface with the Digital Engineering Strategy issued to market previously (T-VT066-19 - STEP WP1 - Production of Roadmap).

As a starting point, the Client has posed the following questions:
What might a breakthrough use case of BIM/IM look like for STEP?
What might a breakthrough use case of digital twinning look for STEP?

The output of this work will be used to inform:
