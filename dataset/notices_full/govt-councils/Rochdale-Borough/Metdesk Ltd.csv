The service will also include forecasts for the Medway area. HT&W has a duty to ensure the effective discharge of the Council's statutory duties and powers as Local Transport & Highway Authority, in particular its duty of care to help ensure safe passage for all road users and the processing and disposal of the household waste. HT&W are not responsible for motorways and trunk roads which are maintained by Highways England (HE). As a part of its responsibilities, Highway Operations (part of HT&W) delivers a winter service for Kent to meet the Council's statutory responsibility as set out to Section 41(1A of the Highways Act 1980, modified on 31st October 2003 by Section 111 of the Railways and Transport Act 2003 (1A): 'In particular, a highway authority is under a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow or ice.' (Medway Council has similar responsibilities for the Medway area). In order to deliver a high quality winter service, a bespoke winter road weather forecast is required to enable decision makers to have accurate information to instruct salting action around the county. Daily forecasts delivered electronically are needed during the winter service period. Winter service activities are costly but efficiencies can be gained with accurate and timely weather information.
