Initially set up by TfGM in 2008 the DDRG consists of people with experience and expertise of their respective areas of disability.  The DDRG covers a number of different types of impairments - including people who use wheelchairs, people with hearing or sight impairments and people with learning difficulties. TfGM asks their views on a range of options when designing transport initiatives.  Naturally, there is not always a general consensus - designs that are suited to (for example) someone using a wheelchair may not be the best designs for someone with a visual impairment, and vice versa - consulting the DDRG makes it possible for TfGM to qualitatively assess the different design options in a much more balanced way, and to hear arguments and opinions from many different perspectives. 
The DDRG acts as a forum which contributes to the development of TfGM infrastructure and services which contributes to meeting the requirements of the Equality Act.  The DDRG provide advice which helps to ensure an appropriate level of access to TfGM infrastructure, campaigns and services for disabled people.

The management and facilitation of the DDRG through an external supplier ensures the service and advice is independent and without influence.",,,"North West","98000000 ",,procurement@tfgm.com,"Transport for Greater Manchester","2, Piccadilly Place,",Manchester,"M1 3BG","United Kingdom",,http://www.tfgm.com,,,,31/08/2018,30/08/2021,16/04/2018,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,105000,105000,29/08/2018,105000,"[Breakthrough UK Ltd|L3 9NG|NONE||Yes|No]","Mr Peter Jackson",31/08/2018,31/08/2021,"Open ",

There is increasing political discussion around the importance of delivering robust and reliable junctions following the introduction of Smart Motorways. To enhance the operation of these junctions it is identified from a previous study that linking the Smart Motorway operating system with the Local Highway Authorities Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system could deliver an integrated network management with collective benefits. Therefore, as part of this investigation into the integration of the operating systems, it is proposed that a Proof of Concept (PoC) is delivered. 
There are underlying Air Quality challenges in Greater Manchester associated with both the SRN and local road network. Highways England has an Air Quality Strategy which has a number of objectives including the dynamic management of traffic both on, and beyond, the SRN. Interventions have been identified by both Highways England and Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). However, none of the proposed measures are exploring collaborative operating regimes.
Highways England is consequently seeking to appoint an appropriate consultant with experience of the Collaborative Traffic Management programme, direct involvement in the development of the Smart Motorway operating regime and an understanding of the Air Quality assessment methods (including involvement in the AQ assessment of the Manchester Smart Motorway scheme).
