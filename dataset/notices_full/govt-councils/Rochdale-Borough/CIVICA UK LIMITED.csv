Any queries should be raised as a message through YORtender. The proposed contract will be for an initial duration of 5 years with a possible 2 x 12 month extensions. City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (the Council) is seeking to appoint a suitably experienced and qualified Provider to deliver a Housing Options IT System. The Council is looking for a mature housing options solution which does not require a large amount of development. The Council's Housing Options Service delivers statutory functions pertinent to advising customers in housing need, assisting to find suitable long-term accommodation, accessing housing related support, undertaking homeless assessments and discharging duty in the Social Housing and Private Rented Sector. The Council is not a stock-holding Authority and it discharges its duties via nominations to Registered Providers (RP). The Council operated Choice Based Lettings for a number of years, it then moved to an automated matching system which is the current methodology. The Council seeks to overcome the disadvantages of both these methods and provide better customer access and more self-service",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","72000000 70333000 75123000 ","Catherine Mullins",catherine.mullins@bradford.gov.uk,"Britannia House","Hall Ings",Bradford,"BD1 1HX","United Kingdom",,http://www.bradford.gov.uk/bmdc,,,,27/08/2019,26/08/2024,05/07/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,250000,300000,02/08/2019,336370,"[Civica UK Limited|SE1 9LQ|NONE||No|No]","Miss Fay Russell",09/08/2019,28/02/2025,"Open ",

1.	Support the choice based lettings processes of those registered providers who are choosing to advertise and allocate properties through their own systems in compliance with the housing allocations policy and associated nominations agreements; and
2.	Operate a traditional nominations process with our other registered providers. 
It is vital therefore that the council's system is able to send and receive data on a daily basis securely and error free to and from providers' systems.
Herefordshire Council's recently approved housing allocation policy will be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of the re-procured IT solution and historic allocations and applicant data should be transferred to the new system along with current applicant data.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.
