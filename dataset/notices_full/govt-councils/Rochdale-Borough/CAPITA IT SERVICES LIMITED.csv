DVNCC001-DN330611-84688729,Contract,"Devon County Council",Awarded,2019-01-08T10:14:50Z,"CP1500-17  Fixed Line Voice and Data Services","DCC operates an internal voice/telephone network which comprises 14 Unify Realitis DX TDM PABXs and a Unify dual node OpenScape Voice VOIP platform. These are linked together via proprietary SIP Trunking running across a managed service MPLS network. The network hosts about 7,000 extensions, spread across approximately 40 sites. Most extensions have an associated DDI number for incoming calls. These DDI services enter the network via DASS at County Hall in Exeter (Central site) and through the SIP service at Taw View in Barnstaple. Alternative routing is employed if the network is congested or down, so that calls will take an alternate route to their destination DCC has moved to a more flexible method of working and uses a speech recognition directory to send calls to the users' nominated device, whether this is a desk extension, mobile, home line or a handset in a partner's location. This is provided by a dual node Netcall Liberty platform and is slowly replacing traditional DDI to contact members of staff. The Liberty platform also provides a voicemail service and some auto attendant services for some of the smaller contact routes into the authority. DCC also operates a 60 seat call centre, based in Tiverton which deals with the majority of incoming calls from the public for Council services, such as Devon Highways, Adult and Childrens Social Care, Trading Standards. This is based on a Unify Realitis DX PABX with intelligent call routing and reporting provided by OpenScape Contact Centre.
