"2015/S 245-444416",Contract,"THE LITMUS PARTNERSHIP LTD",Awarded,2015-12-21T14:46:59Z,"Royal National College for the Blind - Catering Services","The successful tenderer will be required to provide catering services at Royal National College for the Blind.
The tender project is seeking to appoint a Contractor whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the existing facilities for the 130 students on roll and 180 teaching and support staff, with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of Student tastes and dietary requirements.  The College would wish the successful contractor to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.
The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from 1 May 2016 until 30 April 2019 and will operate as a Guaranteed Performance Contract, with the successful Contractor offering the College a guaranteed cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the cash tariff is to remain with Royal National College for the Blind for the duration of this contract.
The College year is based on a calendar of 36 weeks, for the majority of students, although adult students are here for up to 46 weeks and so a service should be available year round, on a reduced basis in non-term time.  
The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the College, which currently includes morning break, lunch, all hospitality and free issue requirements.  Inclusive Student meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.
There are up to 125 students who are residential students and who reside within the College for five or seven days per week, over 36 weeks per annum, 40 of whom may be at the college for up to 46 weeks.
These students will receive, as part of their daily meal entitlement, the following provision:
•	Lunch
•	Evening Meal
In addition, student self-catering Breakfast Provisions are sent to the halls, which are to be supplied by the successful contractor.
There are up to 5 day students, who are entitled to a meal at lunchtime.
Approximately 20 students receive a self-catering allowance for an evening meal with 6 of them having an additional allowance for two lunchtime meals at a weekend. 
Teaching and support staff, will pay for all meals taken throughout the day, at the point of sale. Adult students pay for meals, but do have a discount of 50%.
The sales achieved in 2014/15 were £117,000
Whilst the College prioritises value for money as a key objective of the Competitive Tender Process, the Governing body is not obliged to accept the lowest price.
Royal National College for the Blind expects the successful contractor to enable the continued development of catering through the provision of an innovative, healthy food service, with fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients being prepared on-site. The College expects the successful tenderer to evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement its values.",,"HR1 1EB","West Midlands","55520000 ","The Litmus Partnership",pqq@litmuspartnership.co.uk,"Royal National College for the Blind","College Road",Hereford,"HR1 1EB",England,,http://www.rncb.ac.uk,,"http://www.litmuspartnership.co.uk/project/royal_national_college_for_the_blind ","Interest in the pre-qualification process should be expressed via email only to pqq@litmuspartnership.co.uk, clearly stating within this email which contract / notice you are referring to.
