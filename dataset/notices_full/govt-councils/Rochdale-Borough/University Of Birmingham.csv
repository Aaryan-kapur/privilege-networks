SC5991/17,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM",Awarded,2018-03-28T11:44:09Z,"Upgrade to the University of Birmingham's Library Management system - Alma and Primo applications","The University intends to award a contract for up to five years for the upgrade and maintenance of its current library management system (LMS) to Ex Libris, a specialist in software for the library sector.  This system is owned, supplied and supported exclusively by Ex Libris. 
Since first procuring the Ex Libris LMS in 2013, the University has made a substantial investment in Ex Libris' systems in terms of working processes and staff training. The University has decided to upgrade from Ex Libris' Aleph, SFX, MetaLib, Verde and Primo products to their Alma and Primo products and extend the contract period. The University is due to open an international branch campus in September 2018, for which an LMS capable of being run via cloud-based SaaS will be required. Given the requirement for comprehensive testing in advance of a September opening date, the timescale does not support a full procurement process. In order to achieve the necessary timescales, the University has identified that it needs to work with its existing supplier. The University has additionally identified that the high costs associated with changing LMS supplier are incompatible with the budget and staff capacity available, and therefore when considering the relative benefit, the cost of changing supplier at this time would outweigh the advantage which might accrue.

The University has identified that for reasons of timescale and to achieve its aims within available staff capacity and alongside its core business activities, the products supplied by Ex Libris are the only ones capable of meeting the University's requirements and this is the only viable option for the University at this time.",,,"West Midlands","72000000 ","Thomas Hasson",T.R.Hasson@bham.ac.uk,Edgbaston,,BIRMINGHAM,B152TT,England,"0121 414 2890",,,,,15/12/2017,14/12/2020,22/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1500000,,22/11/2017,1500000,"[EX LIBRIS (UK) LIMITED|3 Dorse Rise, 5th Floor

http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/70159

University College Birmingham is one of the premier Universities in the country with an international reputation for its achievements in its particular field. The College gained university status in 2008 and has gone from strength to strength with ongoing upgrading and expansion of the buildings and Estate.

It currently has circa 8 000 students on role and employs 650 staff.

The College's existing estate can be summarised as follows:

Three main teaching sites located at Summer Row, Richmond House and McIntyre House and two residential sites located in Granville Street (The Maltings and Brindley Drive (Cambrian Halls).

The current cleaning service provision has not been market tested for 5 years and to ensure best value and best practice principles are maintained the Client has decided to tender this provision. The current contract value is circa 600 000 GBP per annum.

As a result of this competitive tender the Client wishes to achieve certain objectives:

- Inward investment from the successful Supplier regarding hi-tech cleaning equipment

- Commercially viable service

- Consistency of cleanliness throughout the University College campuses

- High levels of supervision and contract support across all locations

- Ongoing support and training for staff as a minimum to BICSc Level 1

The contract being tendered is for three years in duration with the possibility of extending for a further two years depending on service deliverability. The contract will commence on 1.4.2018.

The contract is fixed price with the Supplier invoicing the Client for one-twelfth of the annual cost on a monthly basis. Any variations to the contract that are requested by the Client should be invoiced at the agreed rate and should be calculated on an hourly rate per employee needed to carry out the variation to the satisfaction of the contract supervising officer.

Whilst the monthly charge will represent one-twelfth of the contract cost, a reconciliation will take place monthly to reconcile the actual hours worked within the contract. If the hours worked are less than those budgeted for a credit will be required by the Client. The Client expects that the tendered amount of hours are worked at all times and the successful Supplier is expected to have a system in place to cover for both planned and unplanned leave.

One or more EIRs are sought to supplement the support to clients provided by the BizzInn Incubation Manager and other University / Alta Innovations team members (within the Enterprise Acceleration Team).

We want people considered to be expert hi-tech entrepreneurs, who understand what it takes to grow a business from scratch.  They need to have a passion for entrepreneurship and the ability to open doors, encourage, inspire, and facilitate growth. 

The Entrepreneur in Residence will help the team to fulfil the following objectives:
• Provide advice, guidance, coaching and mentoring to the innovators and entrepreneurs within the incubator;
• Increase the visibility of entrepreneurial activity taking place at the Birmingham Research Park, and indeed, within Birmingham itself;
• More sustainable businesses started up, with an increased likelihood of success;
• Help establish BizzInn as a centre of excellence for entrepreneurship so that it can continue to act as a hub for a growing entrepreneurial community in Birmingham (and the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP region);

Infrastructure call to purchase an ultra-high field 1 GHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for the
Henry Wellcome Building for Biomolecular NMR Spectroscopy (HWB-NMR) and for the greater benefit of the
UK life-sciences oriented NMR community. Currently the highest magnetic field available for NMR, this state-ofthe-
art equipment will allow local PIs, collaborators and external users to remain at the forefront of international
research, in terms of scientific applications, methodological development and the recruitment and training of
graduate students and young researchers, fulfilling RC-UK's overarching strategy to support excellence in UK
science. This additional ultra-high field capability will provide a unique enabling technology, supporting a wide
range of science with far-reaching impact.
Spectacular progress has been made over the last decade in isolating the macromolecular complexes that are
fundamental to nearly every cellular process. NMR spectroscopy is a uniquely powerful method for studying the
structured, dynamic, partially structured and intrinsically disordered states of these macromolecular complexes,
at near physiological conditions in atomic detail, and permits their changes to be followed on biologically
relevant time-scales, resulting in crucial mechanistic understanding of their functions. This capability allows both
stable and transient complex biomolecular interactions to be explained in the unprecedented detail necessary
for understanding living processes.
The equipment to be procured comprises a superconducting magnet operating at 1 GHz magnetic field,
a spectrometer console capable of transmitting and receiving radiofrequency of > 1 GHz, associated
cryogenically-cooled probes for measurement of samples in 5 mm tubes as well as for samples at low volume
(35 uL), and a fully temperature-controlled sample changer to fit a 1 GHz magnet to enable high sample

SC7567/19,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM",Awarded,2020-05-14T14:23:53Z,"TENDER FOR THE SUPPLY AND INSTALLATION OF TWO RADAR SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF FORMING A COHERENT NETWORK","This project is funded by the EPSRC and the procurement is dependent on the final funding agreement.

The University of Birmingham invites tenders for supply of two radar systems capable of forming a coherent network. The radars may be scanning but must be capable of operating in a staring mode with overlapped coverage. The radar systems will form part of a physical demonstrator, i.e. facilities created as part of a quantum hub project, which will be used to facilitate and support the demonstration of advanced quantum oscillators and their impact on achievable monostatic and networked radar performance. The radar systems will be used to develop methods to enhance traditional radar performance as well as researching new advanced radar modalities and applications in the broad areas of distributed, coherent, cognitive, high resolution radar sensing. Therefore, it will be required, as part of the project, to build a strong partnership with the technology provider and, ideally, define a joint co-funded R&D programme.

The two radar systems are to enable a two-node radar network to be developed such that it can be used to demonstrate fundamental improvements in RF sensing that come with improved timing. This RF sensor network will serve two main purposes. Firstly, it provides an application-oriented test-bed for the full evaluation of ultra- low phase noise quantum timing sources. Secondly, it will allow development and evaluation of a novel networked radar sensing system in which a highly stable distributed clock signal is central to system coherency, performance and the resulting capability. The following requirements provide guidance but vendors are free to make alternative suggestions where they feel they can match.
The two radar systems should operate at the same frequency with the same bandwidth. The two radar systems should be capable of functioning in a staring mode whereby, ideally, the transmitted signal illuminates the whole of the field of regard and multiple receive beams, preferably formed by digital means, can collectively match the same field of regard. However, it is recognised that a single transmit and receive beam system will be sufficient to enable all requirements to be met. Each radar should have a detection range of at least 3km as evidenced by an adequate signal to noise ratio against a target with a radar cross-section of -20dBsm. The radar field of view should be no less than plus and minus 45 degrees from the radar boresight line. In the horizontal (azimuth) plane and up to an angle of 30 degrees from the ground plane, vertically (i.e., in elevation). Individual beam widths should be no more than 22.5 degrees in the horizontal (azimuthal) plane and 6.5 degrees in the vertical (elevation) plane. Radar range resolution should be no coarser than 150m. The radar systems are to have a processing capacity together with processing algorithms able to detect, track and classify multiple targets. The radar systems must be capable of b",,"B15 2TT",,"38000000 ","Pauline Harrison-Johnson",P.E.Harrison@bham.ac.uk,Edgbaston,,BIRMINGHAM,B152TT,England,,,,,,31/03/2020,31/12/2020,13/09/2019,YES,SC7567/19,Yes,No,No,Products,360000,,16/03/2020,342000,"[AVEILLANT LIMITED|Milton Road

Please note the contracting authority intends to direct award the contract to University of Birmingham. The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.

In order to maintain continuity (until 31 March 2022) it is proposed to retain the current HEI provider to enable HEE to continue to provide high quality learning content in prescribing to health and care staff. The rationale for this decision is to ensure that we are able to fulfill HEE's mandate deliverables (such as working to develop and integrate digital education and learning resources into academic and professional curricula) and actions of the Long Term Plan and People Plan (such as supporting the 5-year action plan for antimicrobial resistance and standardisation of prescribing rights at national level).


The financial envelope for the contract is £665,948.

This, combined with a rapidly changing engineering landscape, corresponding investments by competitor institutions, the School's ambition, forms a compelling basis for a significant investment in the School's estate and infrastructure.
The investment required would transform the School's estate, providing:
i.	A striking new development, which will be a signature build for both the School and the University, with a design synonymous with Engineering at Birmingham.
ii.	Refurbished and upgraded areas of the current Mechanical / Civil building (Y3), to assist in accommodating areas of EESE research activity and student-facing advanced project spaces akin to the CTL Phase 1 space already housed in Y3.

A new School of Engineering building will achieve the aim to co-locate as much of the School's activity as possible, and it will provide the facilities needed in the long-term to allow the School the opportunity to grow significantly (both in terms of student numbers and research strength) and meet its ambitions to be one of the sector leaders for these Engineering disciplines.",,"B15 2TT",,"71541000 ",,l.a.stanwell-jones@bham.gov.uk,Edgebaston,,Birmingham,"B15 2TT",England,,,,,,01/06/2017,31/05/2019,15/05/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,682711.2,,24/05/2017,682711.2,"[Mace Ltd|155 Moorgate, London.
