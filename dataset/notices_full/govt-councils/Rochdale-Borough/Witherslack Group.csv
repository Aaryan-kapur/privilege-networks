Lancashire County Council (LCC) is inviting suitably experienced Service Providers to tender for the opportunity for their Residential Homes to be included on a Flexible Agreement for the Supply of Children & Young People Agency Residential Placements, primarily across the 12 Districts of Lancashire.  For the purposes of this Flexible Agreement LCC will accept Children's Residential Homes located within a 20 mile radius of the LCC boundary (as the crow flies).  

Service Providers offering Children's Homes with Education (as registered by the DfE) are also invited to tender for the opportunity to be included on the Flexible Agreement.  

The focus within the Flexible Agreement will be on quality and creating a culture of co-production and partnership working that will lead to excellent quality services to support Lancashire's cohort of looked after children.

To fully understand the aims and objectives of the service, please refer to the Service Specification and the full tender documentation.

Interested Service Providers should be aware that spend on the current contract is circa £13,000,000 p.a.   The value of the new Flexible Agreement is likely to be lower than the volume mentioned  as current placements are highly likely to continue under existing arrangements.  Any new placements, with effect from 1 August 2016, will be made under the terms of this new Flexible Agreement.  The initial period of the Flexible Agreement will be for 2 years with the option to extend up to any number of defined periods, but not extending beyond 31 July 2022.",,,"North West","85000000 ","Paul Fairclough",paul.fairclough@lancashire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Christ Church Precinct, County Hall,",,Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"(01772) 538206",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41137&e=e ",,01/08/2016,31/07/2022,16/02/2016,YES,CS/CYP/LCC/15/296,No,No,No,Services,78000000,,21/06/2016,78000000,"[Alliance Care and Education Ltd|24 Intake
