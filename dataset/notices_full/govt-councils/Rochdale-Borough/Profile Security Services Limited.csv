Lot 2 - LMB 

Overview of Requirement
The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge requires a high quality security service to ensure that LMB staff and property is suitably protected at all times. The outsourced security service should be perceived as a seamless addition to the in-house support operations of the facility and be of such quality to give a favourable impression to staff and visitors both during occupied and out-of-hours periods. In addition to the core security function, security guards will be required to supplement and provide support to the LMB's receptionist, liaising with staff and visitors on a number of administrative functions. The LMB will work in close partnership with the chosen supplier to achieve these aims.

The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) facility is a seven storey, 4 occupied floor, 32,000m2 GIA facility with a mixture of administration & scientific research laboratories. The facility is comprised of two separate buildings on the site (main building and separate energy centre) and four stainless steel plant towers that provide infrastructure support.
