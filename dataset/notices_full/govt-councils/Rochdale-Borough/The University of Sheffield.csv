In addition to this work, we also aim to use digital PCR to detect pathogens present at low copy number in patient and environmental samples.


Initially the equipment may be housed in one in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital laboratories due to the pandemic (not all University laboratories are currently open and we may need to minimise staff movement between laboratories). It would therefore be an advantage if the machine could be moved to a different location at the University at a later date. It was originally intended to be housed in the NERC Biomolecular Facility and may still move there dependent on future discussions about space.

The group uses a combination of functional genomics, biochemistry and structural biology to probe the mechanism of protein:RNA complexes. The lab is generously funded by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society. The group is also associated with a wider cross-faculty and departmental grouping of labs focused on nucleic acids research within the University of Sheffield as part of the Sheffield Institute for Nucleic Acids; the equipment will therefore be of wider interest to a number of groups within the University. 

Our work studies how non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) interact with and regulate distinct activities in regulatory enzyme complexes that control chromatin accessibility and therefore transcription in mammalian systems. We have previously shown that direct interactions with ncRNAs are a key regulatory factor for these enzymes. The biochemical and structural biology experiments carried out in the group require the formation of diverse protein:nucleic acid complexes, and their subsequent purification to high levels of purity. We also incorporate a variety of fluorophores into our purified samples. As many of these complexes are only weakly associated or transient, accurate sample preparation requires the ability to operate a number of preparation protocols quickly and reproducibly. Importantly, the ability to simultaneously detect the presence of both protein and RNA components in the sample formation reaction would be beneficial to ensure complexes are formed prior to their use in downstream experiments. 

The University now requires a chromatography system to support the research into this area. 
In order to purify proteins, RNA and protein:RNA complexes, the system must be capable of a number of distinct protein purification applications, including but not limited to: Affinity chromatography (e.g Ni/Co affinity, GST, Strep-tag), Anion and cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. To preserve the activity and integrity of the purified samples, the system will be housed in a climate controlled cold cabinet operated at 4C. The ability to control and monitor the system remotely would be advantageous.

To establish the Centre, the University of Sheffield is looking to procure a wide range of equipment focusing on renewable energy, CCUS technologies and smart energy grid.

This tender document is specifically focused on the procurement of a system for Smart Energy Management System (SEM) for research into dynamic grid behaviour and simulation, and to assesses and optimise the operation of individual systems in a multi-element mini-grid, including the performance of CCUS elements. The SEM will be developed in two phases. In the first phase (this tender) the system will focus on monitoring and trending (and simulating) energy flows in real time, including power and heat from generating devices to consumption devices and including electrical energy storage (battery) management and grid export. It will also monitor heat flows based on heat meters from the generating devices, to thermal store, onsite cooling tower and building (and in the future to a wider site heat network). 

In the second phase, separate from this tender, the SEM will be expanded to a full site monitoring system which will also integrate data acquisition, control action for the individual converters and safety from/of individual equipment control systems providing an overall site Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. Whilst phase two is separate from this tender, system designs should take the expansion requirements into account in the design phase.

The University of Sheffield wishes to invite tenders for a 5 axis machine tool on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Machining Group at Catcliffe, South Yorkshire.

Scope of Requirement

This tender exercise is a re-publication of tender 1997/384/EML/AMRC/18 5 Axis High Speed Machining Centre which concluded without award due to failure in the specified lead time requirement.

This exercise is time critical; therefore tenderers are now required to state their best lead time for delivery, installation and commissioning. 

The University seeks to purchase a 5 axis machine tool that will support the AMRC's research into high accuracy prismatic simultaneous milling applications.

As the machine will be utilised for research projects rather than production, the usage will be subject to frequent change to suit different projects. The solution should therefore be readily and rapidly changeable to work on multiple applications.

The machine tool will allow manufacture of components in various materials, primarily aluminium but not excluding alloy steel and stainless steels.  The equipment should allow for machining with high pressure coolant.

The required instrument must be capable of simultaneously analysing heat flow and changes in mass under heating. This enables the identification of phase transitions, structural transitions, thermal events such as combustion, significant mass loss events (e.g. loss of water from a system) and volatilisation of elements during heating. This range of information is vital for understanding the novel synthetic routes under development, and will also give insights into the kinetic vs thermodynamic processes which govern synthesis of functional materials. This covers a huge variety of timely research, in the case for functional oxides, including Li-ion and Na-ion battery materials, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, and future materials for fusion. Functional oxides are of perennial interest and are currently an area for growth with e.g. the EPSRC.

The University of Sheffield wishes to invite tenders for 3D Printers (3 Lots)  on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre at Catcliffe, South Yorkshire.

Scope of Requirement

One of the core areas for the new AMRC North West centre will be to assist and provide guidance to the local Lancashire SME community. From initial canvasing of SME's in the area we have identified that 3D printing is an area with a large amount of immediate interest. 
Because of this, we are looking to purchase three 3D printing technologies to enhance the capability and gain knowledge to pass on to these SME's.

The three lots are required to meet a high demand, provide scope for expansion in the future, and also demonstrate how the technology can replace some traditional equipment. The machines will be used to provide 3D printed components in an expanded range of materials to all research and SME engagement projects across the AMRC North West.

The University of Sheffield wishes to invite tenders for a Robotic Stitching and Trimming Cell on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Castings Group at Catcliffe, South Yorkshire.

Scope of Requirement

A robotic stitching and trimming cell is required. 
The cell will be used for stitching together complex shaped textile preforms (predominately carbon fibre) of geometries typically found in the aerospace and automotive industries. 

Stitching is likely to be required in these preforms for 5 main reasons:
•	Joining together of smaller shaped preforms into one large preform.
•	Stitching the edges to stabilise them.
•	Stitching around inserts or foam cores to locate them.
•	Stitching in specific places to control fibre movement or prevent wrinkling during forming processes.
•	Stitching in specific places to prevent fibre movement in subsequent resin injection processes.

The cell will also have the capability to change the stitching head on the robot with an ultrasonic knife allowing the preform boundaries to be accurately cut.

The cell will be mainly used for stitching and trimming of carbon fibre fabric preforms with geometries typical to those found in the automotive and aerospace industries. Glass and Kevlar fabrics may also need to be stitched. Stitching threads will be carbon, Kevlar, polyester or other thermoplastics. Due to the presence of electrically conductive carbon fibre the equipment should be suitably protected from conductive dust ingress.

The project is for the building of a covered storage facility with crane capacity of 50 Tonne. This is the ideal solution although a lower rating of crane may be acceptable if 50 Tonne is not possible due to site conditions and ground bearing capacities.
 

The objective is to provide a facility on a location on the Nuclear AMRC site that can store tests piece, materials and equipment to a weight of 50 Tonne. A feasibility study is required to determine the optimum location considering logistics of handling large items and budget constraints.  There are two site locations which would be suitable but each with different ground bearing capacities and access issues.

The aim is to expand the capability of this system to a WTE boiler to enable the combustion of a wider range of fuels, including drier pelletised fuels, as well as fuels that are classed as 'clean waste', including:

- vegetable waste from agriculture or forestry,
- vegetable waste from the food processing industry,
- untreated non-hazardous wood waste (formerly known as Grade A recycled wood)

The new WTE system will provide a demonstrator of low-carbon technologies and to support a wide range of research activities.

The overall specification is divided into 3 parts to be awarded as one contract:

Part 1: Fuel silo and conveying system;

Part 2: High-efficiency electrostatic precipitator (ESP);

Part 3: Flue gas stack with flue gas extraction.

Suppliers are requested to offer a complete solution in their return, including offers to all 3 parts of the tender.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","44621200 ","James Noble",james.noble@sheffield.ac.uk,"Western Bank",,SHEFFIELD,S102TN,England,,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/sheffield ",,29/09/2020,30/09/2020,18/03/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,140020,,14/09/2020,140020,"[Gilles Biomass Heating Ltd|Unit 215b Holme Lacy Road

To complement our research capability, we are looking to procure a high pressure heat exchanger (HPHE) test bed.

The high pressure, high temperature heat exchanger (HEX) test bed is aimed at supporting R and D in high-efficiency power conversion cycles, focussing on supercritical CO2 (sCO2) for oxy-fired gas cycles (Allam cycle) but also with global applications in other power and industrial sectors. The objective is to establish a flexible test loop ideally capable of operating at pressures up to 370 bar, support R and D in oxy-fired gas cycles, but in general it is envisaged the facility will enable the study of high efficiency heat exchangers covering areas such as heat transfer, pressure drop, thermal stresses, and impact of phase changes, impurities, fouling, corrosion and materials research. It will provide performance data for the sCO2 cycle to model and evaluate designs, e.g. heat exchanger sizing. We are estimating tender submissions of between GBP 300 000 and GBP 400 000.

Scope:

The supply, installation and commissioning of a hybrid machine tool  for practical research into additive and  subtractive manufacture of complex components such as gears.  The equipment will be used to demonstrate novel and emerging methods of additive manufacture and ultrasonic assisted subtractive machining on a single platform and should have the flexibility to manufacture numerous sorts of component from the aerospace, automotive and other high value manufacturing industries; including gears, shafts, casings and housing, disks, blades, etc.  The equipment will also support the AMRC’s fundamental research into technologies such as machinability, dynamics and process monitoring, particularly with regard to the novel processes of additive manufacture and ultrasonic assisted subtractive manufacture.  As the equipment will be utilised for research projects rather than production, its usage will be subject to frequent change to suit different projects.

This funding includes provision to establish some key facilities in support of the research programme of the Hub. The specific facility being sought in this tender will provide a means of measuring hysteresis characteristics and AC core loss of soft magnetic material samples. It will be used almost entirely for the characterisation of laminated electrical steels (SiFe, CoFe and NiFe) for use in electrical machines and not high frequency cores for power supplies etc. Hence, medium frequency measurements of core loss (up to 1kHz) will cover the overwhelming majority of potential usage. It will be used almost exclusively for research purposes and not for offering commercial measuring services. A key use will be for evaluating the effect of electrical machine manufacturing methods on core loss.

We focus on the problems of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from fundamental science to translation into clinical benefit. We bring together scientists and clinicians to tackle all aspects of AMR. One aspect of our work relates to understanding the molecular mechanisms of AMR. The ability to measure molecular interactions in a quantitative manner will enhance our research capabilities. The ability to measure the strength of interactions is crucial to mechanistic understanding, e.g. between a bacterial protein and an antibiotic.

Our current equipment is a single channel, operator-intensive machine that is suitable for preliminary studies on molecules with a molecular weight of > 10,000 Da. This has become a bottleneck for our studies due to: 1) its low capacity and 2) its inability to detect interactions between small molecules has prompted us to acquire extra capabilities and increased throughput.

2388/460/JT/NW/19,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD",Awarded,2020-03-10T15:06:04Z,"5 Axis Milling Machine Purchase","This tender is for the supply, installation and commissioning of a 5-axis milling machine for use in research machining studies. The equipment will be used for testing and demonstration purposes in the AMRC North West's interim facility in Preston and ultimately in a new facility at Samlesbury. 
The equipment will support the AMRC's research into technologies such as machinability, dynamics and process monitoring. The equipment should have adequate robustness, high precision and repeatability to facilitate the manufacture of high performance aerospace, automotive and similar parts with demanding tolerance requirements.  As the equipment will be utilised for research projects rather than production, its usage will be subject to frequent change to suit different projects.  The solution should therefore be readily and rapidly changeable to work in new modes of operation.

Compulsory requirements: 
 
1.	Must have the ability to machine a range of aerospace, automotive and other high value manufacturing industries; including titanium, nickel superalloys, steel and stainless steel.
2.	Machine including ancillaries must not exceed 3000mm (length) x 3000mm (width) and 3000mm (height) see attached Diagram 1 for more detail. 
3.	Must weigh a maximum 10,000Kg or less.
4.	Must have a tool magazine with a capacity of at least 25 tools.
5.	Must include Sprint Probe.
6.	Must have a minimum spindle speed of 18,000RPM.
7.	Must allow machining with 20 bar pressure coolant, through   tool coolant and flood.
8.	Must have a working envelope (diameter x height) no less than 400 x 400 mm for all modes of operation.

Brief Description of Requirement

The overall context of this tender is the ongoing ESA four-satellite Cluster mission which was successfully launched in July and August 2000. Each Cluster spacecraft contains a complete suite of eleven instruments to measure magnetic and electric fields, electromagnetic waves, and particles. The Cluster nominal mission phase started on 1 February 2001. Planned to last for 2 years, it has been extended numerous times and on 22 November 2016 ESA's Science Programme Committee (SPC) approved a further two year extension to the end of 2018 with an option on a further extension up to end 2020 (TBC by the ESA SPC meeting in
February or June 2017).
From the beginning, a critical part of the Cluster Science Ground Segment has been the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC) located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, a facility operated by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). In addition to JSOC carrying out its baseline operational activities ESA has now requested, starting in early 2017, that JSOC also carries out specific Operations Support for four of the five WEC instruments (DWP, EFW, STAFF and WHISPER - referred to WEC#4 for clarity) on each of the four Cluster Satellites. However, STFC does not possess the in-house expertise, or systems, to be able to carry out WEC#4 Operations Support and will therefore subcontract this work out.
The specific context, and purpose, of this tender is to seek specific operational support for the WEC#4 instruments on each satellite, the details of which are given in the Statement of Work for WEC#4 Operations Support, document Appendix A DS-JSOC-SoW-0002. Further details of the Cluster mission, the WEC#4 instrument and its operation are given in the list of Appendix B

As part of the Mental Health Support Teams a new role called the Education Mental Health Practitioner (EMHP) is being established.

The implementation of the EMHP role will be underpinned by practitioners undertaking an accredited post graduate/graduate certificate programme of education and supervision in clinical practice. On successful completion of the programme, the learner will be equipped with the necessary skills, knowledge and capabilities to work as a qualified EMHP providing early intervention support for children and young people with mild to moderate mental health problems, and signposting to NHS and other appropriate services for further support.

This provision will split over 6 Geographic Lots.

The maximum value of this programme is £15,120,000 inclusive of any applicable VAT over a three year period across all 6 Lots.  The Authority reserves the right to extend the contracts by up to a further two years, to be determined on a Lot basis.

The first year of the programme will be up to £2,520,000 across all 6 Lots (£420,000 each Lot for tuition and supervision).

The funding is set at tuition costs of £11,500, inclusive of any applicable VAT, per learner in respect of the delivery of a postgraduate/graduate certificate completing the programme over a maximum period of 12 months.  The amount of £5,000, inclusive of any applicable VAT, will be available for training each Supervisor, with the expectation that supervisors can support up to two EMHP Trainees (1:2 Supervision trainer ratio). However, this may be adjusted for future cohorts as the training numbers increase.

It intends to conduct surveys of Victorian rail infrastructure and a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is required to take full responsibility for all commercial aspects from ""pre-spin-out"" to fully-fledged company with revenues in the region £10m -£30m.

RIIL will utilise novel IP and know-how from three universities; (Durham, Sheffield and Saint Mary's London), and a well-established Rail contractor.   It will help Network Rail Ltd to more efficiently maintain their portfolio of 332 Victorian railway tunnels and 171 Victorian brick built viaducts.  Current inspection methods require physically drilling into the structure to discover unseen ""voids"".   RIIL will offer a non-destructive alternative to this inspection method.  The equipment and methods are new to the rail environment.
The first market for RIIL services is intended to be the UK Rail network.  Additional markets such as mining, mine remediation and utilities (sewage and water) also exist.  Additionally, if resolution can be improved, complicated structures, such as older buildings, could be surveyed for damage or faults.  This potential market is currently not completely understood and addressing this will be a key task of the CEO. 

Sheffield, Durham and St Mary's University are currently collaborating in a joint research to develop a next generation, high TRL level instrument in Sheffield.  This work will continue in parallel to the Northern Accelerator work and the CEO will be expected to collaborate with it in order to maximise the benefits to the future spinout company.",,,"North East","79400000 66171000 ","Natalie Morton",natalie.morton@ncl.ac.uk,"Newcastle University","Procurement Services, Kingsgate",Newcastle,"NE1 7RU","United Kingdom","+44 1912086396",http://www.ncl.ac.uk,,,,16/04/2019,30/09/2019,08/03/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,25000,25000,16/04/2019,19800,"[Dr Chris Steer|54 Southern Road, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 3EA|NONE||Yes|No]",,17/04/2019,30/09/2019,"Open ",
