The waste is collected by Wigan Council's in house service and deposited in bunkers at a centralised Depot for collection by the service provider. Generally, the quantity to be collected by the contractor is expected to be an average of approximately 250 tonnes per month, however, this is only an indicative figure.  The actual quantities may vary due to seasonality and ad-hoc gully emptying.  In particular, the quantity is likely to be significantly higher in the autumn due to leaf litter. Operationally, the area designated for the storage and transfer of Road Sweepings and Gully waste is relatively small, and situated on the site's one way vehicular access route.  Therefore, frequent (sometimes daily) removal is required and access to site's traffic route  may only be maintained uninterrupted if an eight wheeler vehicle is used. The service requires the contractor to collect, haul and treat the Road Sweepings and Gully Waste, and to achieve the highest recycling rates possible. To that end the contractor will need to evidence that the recycling rate meets national (wastedateflow) reporting requirements.  The full specification detailing the service requirements is provided in the Invitation to Tender Documentation.
