ROCH001-DN61443-12549728,Contract,"Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council",Awarded,2018-06-01T11:53:57Z,"Integrated Sexual Health Service (C161)","Rochdale Council acting on behalf of Bury, Oldham and Rochdale Councils (the commissioners) are commissioning an Integrated Sexual Health Service. Bury and Rochdale are also commissioning a 'Young Peoples Sexual Health Support Service' and a 'Young Persons Clinical Service' as part of this service provision  
 
 
The provider will provide an all age integrated sexual health service (including where contractually agreed Bury and Rochdale; the Young Peoples Sexual Health Support Service and Young Peoples Clinical Service) to ensure seamless access for patients requiring contraception and STI testing and treatment services; and providing holistic care to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment and care regardless of the primary reason for presentation. The service will deliver integrated (not simply co-located) provision provided under one management structure. The provider will work in partnership with other locally commissioned services for young people both clinical and non-clinical to maintain and develop homogeneous pathways of care. The provider will provide dual trained nursing staff who can provide both contraceptive and STI care. This provides better patient care as this reduces or removes boundaries between traditional sexual health disciplines. ""Dual trained"" means that clinical nursing staff will have training in both provision of contraception and management of sexually transmitted infections. The provider will also provide medical consultant staff who are dual trained and/sufficient sessions of medical consultant time to enable both STI and contraceptive service provision to be consultant led.",,,"North West","85000000 98000000 ","Peter Walpole",peter.walpole@star-procurement.gov.uk,"Trafford Town Hall","Talbot Road",Stretford,"M32 0TH","United Kingdom","+44 7875635549",http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=e427594e-4890-e511-80fb-000c29c9ba21 ",,09/11/2015,31/03/2021,19/06/2015,NO,,No,No,No,Services,16882025,16882025,02/09/2015,16318126,"[Virgin Care Services Limited|Lynton House, 7-12 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9LT|NONE||No|No]",,09/11/2015,31/03/2021,"Open ",
