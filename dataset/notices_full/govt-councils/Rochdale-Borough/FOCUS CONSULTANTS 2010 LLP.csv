"CRH 02620",Contract,NOE-CPC,Awarded,2018-12-19T14:53:14Z,"Chesterfield Borough Council Consultancy Advice","Chesterfield Borough Council is seeking to procure a suitably qualified consultant to undertake a feasibility study into the potential creation of the Derbyshire Rail Industry  Innovation Vehicle (DRIIVe) facility at Barrow Hill Round House in Chesterfield. The maximum budget for the feasibility study is circa ?50,000 inc VAT.
      
      It is envisaged that DRIIVe will see the creation of a Rail Innovation and Training Centre that will enhance an already thriving centre of railway maintenance and engineering.  In addition to a suite of specialist Rail Research and Development Laboratories and a Training Centre, the facility will provide commercial office and rail engineering workshop space.  
      The concept has been developed as a result of a collaborative partnership between Barrow Hill Engine Shed Society, Chesterfield Borough Council, Chesterfield College, the University of Derby and Newcastle University.   Partners have committed to working with a single inward investor to develop DRIIVe where the intention is that the facility will become a focus for rail innovation and training as well as providing commercial office and rail engineering  workshop space.  It is hoped that DRIIVe will facilitate growth in jobs across the wider supply chain, building upon the existing commercial offer at Barrow Hill which currently supports 65 rail related jobs.
      The purpose of the feasibility study is to inform and formalise discussions taking place  around the development of the DRIIVe Centre.  It is envisaged that the feasibility study will help us understand how the proposed uses within the building will function and based on this provide design and cost proposals for the centre up to RIBA stage 2+,  that take into account the site and its environment.
