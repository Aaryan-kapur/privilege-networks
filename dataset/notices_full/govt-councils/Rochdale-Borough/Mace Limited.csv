Both centres are located in Kenilworth, Warwickshire.
       
      Warwick District Council has managed the LDP since 2013. The first phase of the programme, after an appropriate and detailed scoping exercise, was the refurbishment and extension of Newbold Comyn and St Nicholas Park Leisure Centres, in a project costing £16 million.
       
      Phase Two of the LDP is the refurbishment and extension and/or replacement of the Council's two leisure centres in Kenilworth - the Abbey Fields Swimming Pool and Castle Farm Recreation Centre. At present there are a number of different opportunities identified for both buildings. Both sites offer a number of significant opportunities and restraints. The Supplier will evaluate what options are appropriate for each of the buildings, and carry out an options appraisal which recommends specific options to the Council for consideration.
       
      The Abbey Fields Swimming Pool currently contains a 25 metre indoor swimming pool; a free-form outdoor swimming pool; a free-form outdoor paddling pool; separate male and female changing rooms; a sauna and a café area with internal and external serving hatches.  The area under consideration in this project includes 5 outdoor tennis courts and a disused sports pavilion near to the swimming pool.
       
      Castle Farm Recreation Centre contains a four badminton court main hall; a 28 station gym; a small meeting room; changing rooms for indoor and outdoor sport and a vending area. The first floor of the building is currently occupied by the local District Scout Association.
       
      The Supplier will be selected by mini-competition under the Crown Commercial Services procurement process RM3741 (Lot 1).

The Department’s Group Property Board lead on property matters across DfT and Agencies.  Property matters on five themes are coordinated through the Property Group Operating Model, with one theme being Facilities Management (FM).  The general principle is for all parties to coordinate, share best practice, and to seek efficiencies by acting as one and aggregating activity, resources and spend.
The DfT Group has four principal Total Facilities Management (TFM) contracts, plus a collection of smaller arrangements in-place for BTP.  The proposal is to replace all of these with a single contracted FM model (‘The Service Model’) to serve all estates.  The contract(s) are to be procured from the mandated CCS FM Framework ; that is one procurement for many.
The Government Property Shared Services Programme (PSSP) has allied The Department with DEFRA.  DEFRA is constrained under their current FM provision until 2024, yet one of their agencies (The Environment Agency) is available to join subject to internal governance and Cabinet Office approvals.

The brief calls for a highly sustainable new building that is distinctive, with exceptional design quality, reflecting UCL’s global significance whilst not appearing elitist. It should be a building that is accessible, inclusive, and welcoming. 

The New Student Centre will provide two primary functions: student learning space and a Student Enquiries Centre.  A range of student learning spaces are required, and the building will provide ‘social’ spaces including a cafe as well as space for exhibitions.  The learning spaces will vary in character and size, creating different types of individual study and group collabora¬tion settings.  None of the spaces will be used for formal teaching.  Dedicated to the needs of the students, the building will deliver spaces and furniture solutions that are flexible, adaptable, and IT resourced, with effective power provision. 

Flanked by listed buildings, the new building will occupy a central campus site within the Bloomsbury Conservation area.  The site is a prime entrance to UCL’s Bloomsbury campus and is used extensively by both pedestrians and vehicles.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 12 months.  The total estimated value stated includes the option period.

As a Central Purchasing Body as defined by the EU Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU ('the Directive'), the Framework Agreement is open for use by Contracting Authorities (as defined by the Directive) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; or any Contracting Authority established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available on: https://www.espo.org/About-us-(1)/FAQs/Legal/How-does-ESPO-define-the-geographical-areas,-reffe

ESPO proposes to establish a commercial trading company whose target clients will be third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier will be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with that commercial trading company on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
The Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation. The company will enter into the framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.",,,"Any region","70331000 70332000 71000000 72224000 79000000 90710000 ",ESPO,tenders@espo.org,"Barnsdale Way, Grove Park",Enderby,Leicester,"LE19 1ES",England,"+44 1162657943",www.espo.org,,,,01/01/2018,31/12/2020,26/10/2017,YES,2664_18,Yes,Yes,No,Services,50000000,,19/12/2017,50000000,"[AA PROJECTS LIMITED|Sibson Road
