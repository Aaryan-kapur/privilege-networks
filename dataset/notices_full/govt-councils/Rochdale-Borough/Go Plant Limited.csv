Sandwell MBC Fleet Services (“Fleet Services”) is responsible for co-ordinating vehicle hire throughout Sandwell. Fleet Services is working with the Corporate Procurement Service in order to establish a framework agreement for the provision of vehicle hire to supply a range of vehicles, including cars, vans, mini-buses, tippers and other specialist vehicles, (“Framework Agreement”) to meet the vehicle hire requirements of Sandwell MBC (the “Council”). Fleet Services invited interested suppliers (“Tenderers”) to participate in a tender exercise in relation to the Framework Agreement. 

The Council is a member of the Black Country Purchasing Consortium, which is a partnership in procurement formed between the borough councils of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and the city council of Wolverhampton. One of the primary objectives of the Black Country Purchasing Consortium is to establish collaborative framework agreements for the supply of goods and services that are commonly purchased across all four local authorities. It was for each individual local authority to determine if they would like to participate in / utilise each individual framework agreement.

The Framework Agreement is primarily for use by the borough councils of Sandwell, Walsall, Dudley and the city council of Wolverhampton. However, the Black Country Purchasing Consortium supports government recommendations with regards to collaborative working. As a result, the framework is available for use by any Local Authority Establishment within the West Midlands.

For the purpose of this tender exercise, at the time of advertisement the borough council of Sandwell and the city council of Wolverhampton have confirmed their intention to utilise this framework agreement. However, the borough council of Dudley and the borough council of Walsall may wish to utilise it during the term of the framework agreement.

The framework agreement will include a maximum of 5 contractors (subject to sufficient acceptable tender documents received) for each type of vehicle / hire period.",,"B69 3DB","West Midlands","50111100 34140000 34144400 34114400 50111110 34114000 34134000 60100000 60000000 34136000 ","Sam Turner",sam_turner@sandwell.gov.uk,"Freeth Street",Oldbury,"West Midlands","B69 3DB","United Kingdom","0121 569 3619",,,,,01/08/2016,31/07/2020,15/04/2016,NO,,No,No,No,Products,0,,02/08/2016,0,"[Access Hire Nationwide|Tuscany Way, Europort Industrial Estate, Normanton, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, WF6 2UA|||No|No][Arnold Clark Finance Ltd.
