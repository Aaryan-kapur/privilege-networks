BFDMDC001-DN492396-39507172,Contract,"Bradford Metropolitan District Council",Awarded,2020-08-21T11:38:09Z,"Tender for Electronic Redaction Software","The full specification and details of how to respond to the tender can be found on www.yortender.co.uk reference DN492396.

City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (the Council) is seeking to appoint a suitably experienced and qualified Provider (the Provider) to deliver a redaction software product.
The proposed contract will be for an initial duration of three (3) years with a possible two (2) twelve (12) month extensions. The Council reserves the right to amend the scope of the support requirement for the extension period. 
The procurement of the software is to be initially used by the Department of Corporate Resources to irreversibly block out selected data including confidential and sensitive information when dealing with Subject Access Requests or other documentation.  This could be from electronic files and documents in varying formats.  However, this may be rolled out to other Departments who require the same facility. 

The current redacting process being used by Officers is a manual one.  Documents are redacted using a redacting pencil or via the paint function on word.  Documents are then printed out and re-scanned prior to disclosure to ensure the redacted information cannot be viewed or reversed in any way.  This is currently a resource intensive and cumbersome process considering the Council only have one month to respond to a request. If a case requires a vast amount of redacting, the manual process is very time consuming.

The current approach to meeting legislative demands on disclosures is inefficient resulting in a need to improve processes that enable delivery of Subject Access Requests (SAR) making them compliant with mandated timelines for response. Redaction of documents in hard(paper) and electronic copy is very manpower intensive which adds significant delay to meeting the deadlines. Reducing the time to conduct redaction is viewed as the priority action that can deliver greatest improvement to the SAR process.

The CL1 Framework allows Brook Street (UK) Ltd to continue to provide services for a 12 month time frame beyond the ordering period. As a result, CCS has invoked this contractual provision to ensure public sector customers have continuity of service while the procurement for the replacement framework is underway, and CLone will continue until 18th June 2018.

The targeted review will:
•	Provide a comprehensive assessment of asset health reporting which will include the identification of outliers.

•	Enable Ofwat to assess whether companies are taking full ownership of, and responsibility for, asset health.

•	Evaluate the relative balance of performance and condition monitoring/assessment within the context of new technology.

•	Evaluate the assurance which companies receive for new assets.

Scope

The scope of this work includes assessing company's evaluation, management and interventions with regards asset health. Any recommendations for alternative approaches for PR19 should be within the context of the overall framework of a total expenditure approach to cost assessment and the outcomes framework. Recommendations should aim to enhance customer legitimacy, enable cost effective/timely investment and provide assurance for resilience.

Key Tasks

In order to meet the business objectives, the project will involve the Contractor performing the following tasks:
•	Attending and leading meetings with all water companies (WASC's/WOC's) at their premises, however we would consider conducting some of the meetings via teleconference. A member of the Ofwat team will aim to support at these meetings. 

•	Discussions and short debrief with the Ofwat team following each company meeting.

•	Input into pre-meeting briefing/information pack for companies as necessary. This may include collecting information from companies before the meeting, too.

•	Regular weekly discussions with the Ofwat team regarding the project, next steps and highlighting any areas of concern.

•	A weekly email to the project manager concerning budget spent, remaining and forecast expenditure for the remainder of the contract.

•	Review of available technology and approaches for performance and condition monitoring.

Key Deliverables

The Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:
A draft and final report; detailing the approach and findings of the targeted review. This should be focused on addressing the questions highlighted in this ToR and include findings from discussions with companies and methods of addressing any concerns regarding robustness and consistency of asset health methodology and investment planning. The draft report should be produced no later than 15 March 2017. Earlier versions can be shared and discussed prior to this. We may request that the draft report be presented to a group of Ofwat colleagues.

The final report (a full and a redacted version if required), suitable for publication, should be produced no later than 31 March 2017. Ofwat may wish to disclose the final report separately or as part of a publication. The final report should include recommendations for next steps, particularly on increasing transparency and consistency of standards across the sector.",,,"West Midlands,London","71330000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"R PROC 01.0546 Signed by both parties.pdf ",,,01/02/2017,31/03/2017,25/01/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,87420,31/01/2017,87420,"[Halcrow Group Limited|Elms House

PROC.01.0514,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2016-07-04T10:34:10Z,"Targeted review of market participants' readiness for the opening of the retail market for eligible business, charity and public sector customers of companies whose areas are wholly or mainly in England","Objective

The targeted review will:

•	Provide us with external assurance that the participants will be ready for market opening;
•	Highlight any areas of risk to the opening the market, and therefore where we can challenge market participants to improve;
•	Send a strong signal to stakeholders about the industry's collective commitment that the retail market will be ready on time.

Scope

The scope of this work is limited to the assurances that water companies that are wholly or mainly in England will be ready for market opening in April 2017, in relation to the following three areas that we have assessed as being highest risk to the opening of the market. 

•	What assurances are there that market participants' decisions about how they run their businesses ensure a level playing field, and therefore what assurances are there that appointed companies will not discriminate in favour of their own services and customers?
•	What assurances are in place that market participants are planning to improve their systems and data quality?
•	What assurances are there that participants will be ready to deal with different 'customer journeys'? What assurances, and are there plans in place, that they will be ready to deal with for example
o	New customers
o	Losing a customer
o	Customer retention
o	Resolving the issue when something goes wrong 

We require an independent assessment of the strength of the assurances for the above three areas.

We would also like the Contractor to identify the level of review that would be appropriate for:

•	the two Welsh companies;
•	New appointments and variations (NAVs); and
•	potential new entrants and companies who might become retailers

Key Tasks

In order to meet the business objectives, the project will involve the Contractor performing the following types of tasks, although we would consider other methods:

•	Designing a questionnaire and sending it out to all market participants to identify, at a high level, the assurances around the three areas listed under the Scope section.
•	Assessing the responses to the questionnaire and drawing conclusions at this high level.
•	Provide input into Ofwat's decision as to which market participants to target for a more in depth review of the areas identified as highest risk to readiness of market opening.
•	Attending and leading meetings with market participants judged as highest risk to overall market readiness.
•	Producing a final report.

Key Deliverables

The Contractor will be required to produce the following key deliverables.
The draft report shall be produced no later than 1 August 2016. Earlier versions can be shared and discussed prior to this. We may request that the draft report be presented to a group of Ofwat colleagues.

The final report (a full and redacted version if required) shall be produced no later than 15 August 2016.

We do not intend to review the water resources or sludge business unit boundaries or the activities and services within the water resources or sludge business units as developed through accounting separation and defined in Regulatory Accounting Guidelines (RAG 4).

•	Input into pre-meeting briefing/information pack for WASC’s as necessary.
