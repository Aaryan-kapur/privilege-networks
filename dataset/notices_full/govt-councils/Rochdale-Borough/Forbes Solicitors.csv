As such the Contracting Authority wishes to establish a Framework Agreement to access the support it requires, in order to enable the achievement of GDPR compliance across the Council and all associated agencies. The agencies associated with the Council include Maintained Schools and Academy Trusts (160+ organisations), Town and Parish Councils (5 organisations) and Housing Service Providers (2 organisations). All of these agencies operate with a significant amount of Personal Data and therefore require support with their GDPR implementation. The Framework Agreement has 8 Lots; 1. GDPR transition services 2. Data Processor Management - including Data Flow Mapping and Record Of Processing Activity 3. Privacy Practices - including DPIA's 4. Information Architecture and Records Management 5. Information Security Practices and Incident Management 6. Data Protection Framework including Policies and Procedures 7. Data Protection Training 8.
