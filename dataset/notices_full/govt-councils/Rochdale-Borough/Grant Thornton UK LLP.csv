"UK SBS PS16168 Future Capacities and Capabilities of the UK Steel Industry",Contract,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",Awarded,2016-09-12T08:40:47Z,"UK SBS PS16168 Future Capacities and Capabilities of the UK Steel Industry","The dynamics of the global steel industry have changed significantly in recent years. From the peak reached in 2011 to the start of 2016 the price of steel has more than halved, with contributing factors including overcapacity at a global level, weaker demand in Europe and expanded supply from China. 
The steel industry in the UK is already under significant pressure from these forces, as demonstrated by the closure of SSI UK’s Redcar steelworks in 2015.
Throughout the global steel price downturn, the department has provided ongoing support to Britain’s steelmaking and British steelworkers to deliver a long-term, sustainable sector. That support has already seen tens of millions of pounds of compensation paid to energy intensive industries and will see them exempted from climate policy costs. The department has also protected the industry from unfair trading practices and has helped the government become the first to implement new guidelines making it easier for the public sector to buy British steel.

The overriding aim of this business analysis and research is to assess the extent to which the current capability of the UK steel sector is well aligned to the potential future demands of the UK and EU markets. Such analysis at a company level will identify the industry’s strengths and weaknesses in market strategies and positions, as well as the areas where it needs to adapt and develop and what the barriers to this are. The output will assist industry and government in developing a long-term plan working together for a sustainable and competitive UK steel industry.

Central to the study is engagement with steel consumers across a wide range of UK industrial sectors. A robust assessment of future UK demand for steel products by sector will be based on direct engagement with consuming sectors on their future business plans, have credibility with industry, and stand up to scrutiny from industry and the Steel Council. It will also require direct engagement with steel producers to understand their commercial strategies and how they are adapting to developing steel markets. 

Given the commercially sensitive nature of future business planning, the successful bidder will be well placed to gain the trust and co-operation of purchasers throughout the steel supply chain and in a range of key sectors. BIS will provide assistance where possible to supplement your own efforts to secure interviews.",,,"Any region","73200000 ",,Professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"North Star House","North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,,,,07/09/2016,06/03/2017,25/08/2016,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,175000,06/09/2016,166254.75,"[Grant Thornton UK LLP|Grant Thornton House

PROC.01.0581,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2018-04-12T14:39:48Z,"Independent Review of Financial Model","In setting price limits every 5 years, we have regard to our duties laid down in section 2 of the Water Industry Act 1991 as amended by subsequent Acts.
In summary our main statutory duties are to: 
•	protect the interests of consumers, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition; 
•	secure that the companies properly carry out their functions; 
•	secure that the companies can finance the proper carrying out of their functions, and 
•	secure long-term resilience.

To enable us to meet our duties and set price limits Ofwat uses a bespoke financial model. For PR14 Ofwat developed its financial model in partnership with PwC. The PR14 financial model had three purposes:
•	To determine the wholesale price controls.
•	To calculate the revenues arising from the retail price controls.
•	To help assess financeability of the appointee, with the ability to refine the wholesale price control limits until target financeability indicators are satisfied.
The model went through significant development during the price review process, with six versions of the financial model being published.
We are currently developing a new financial model to use at PR19. We released a draft of this model in July 2017, alongside our consultation ""Delivering Water 2020: Consulting on our methodology for the 2019 price review"". The draft consultation financial model and rulebook is available here:
https://064f1d25f5a6fb0868ac-0df48efcb31bcf2ed0366d316cab9ab8.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Draft-PR19-financial-model.xlsm
We received a number of comments on the model and are currently preparing a revised version of the model for publication on 13 December 2017.
Objectives and scope of the work
The objective of the work is ensure the W2020 Senior Responsible Officer and other stakeholders will have independent assurance that the revised PR19 financial model is fit for purpose. This will help create trust and confidence in the PR19 financial model, and allow stakeholders such as water companies to have greater assurance in the results generates.

The scope of the work is to provide advice on:

a)	whether the methodology used in the model fits with Ofwat's policy requirements outlined in the final methodology document 
b)	whether the formulae in the model have been implemented correctly 
c)	how to correct issues found with the model and to ensure it complies with best practice with Ofwat's policy requirements 

It should be noted that the contractor will not be expected to implement any of the changes or recommendation that are identified.

Ofwat expects to publish the finished external review report on our website. By tendering for the work the Contractor accepts that the final report will be publishable.",,,"West Midlands,London","79212000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,,,"For further information, please contact: procurement@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk",13/12/2017,28/02/2018,14/11/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,45711,04/12/2017,45711,"[Grant Thornton UK LLP|30 Finsbury Square

Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group (LCCCG), East Leicestershire & Rutland Clinical Commissioning Group (ELRCCG) and West Leicestershire Clinical Commissioning Group (WLCCG).
Background, Aims and Objectives of Service
Following the changes to the local external audit arrangements from the Local Audit Accountability Act 2014, NHS trusts and clinical commissioning groups now need to procure and locally appoint their own auditors for the year 2017- 2018 and subsequent financial years. There are a number of requirements set in legislation; these include the role of auditor panels, and that auditors have to be registered through the regulation process to be eligible to audit local public bodies. The duties of the auditors are set out in the Act, together with their compliance with the Code of Audit Practice issued by the National Audit Office (NAO). Appointments must be made by 31 December 2016.
The aims and objectives of this project were to commission an External Audit Service for the LLR CCG's, via the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (through a mini-competition), with a view to making cost savings for all three LLR CCG's.",,,"East Midlands","79212300 ",,LLRProcurement@ardengemcsu.nhs.uk,"AGSCU, St John's House,",,Leicester,"LE1 6NB",England,,,,,,01/04/2017,31/03/2020,20/10/2016,NO,,No,No,No,Services,343140,,22/12/2016,343140,"[Grant Thornton UK LLP|Melton Street, London, NW1 2EP|||No|No]",,01/04/2017,31/03/2020,"Other ",

We have Investors in People status council-wide and are also proud to have achieved the highest level of the Equality Standard. However, the Council continues to face significant financial challenges due to the government’s ongoing austerity measures which will result in further reductions to the Public sector funding envelope.
The Council currently spends a total of £1.2bn on its activities, including schools and Tower Hamlets Homes and has a net General Fund revenue budget of £362m in 2016/17. We estimate that savings of some £60m will be required over the MTFS period 2017/18 to 2019/20.
Understanding and prioritising all of the Council's resources over the medium term – both revenue and capital – is critical to its future financial sustainability and service effectiveness. In order to address these financial challenges, the Council will need to;
 Manage its resources in the context of funding uncertainties, a rising population and increasing demand for some of its key services including adult social care.
 Radically change how the Council prioritises and allocates its resources, including through investment and saving decisions
 Create a better alignment of Council budget/services to its Strategic Priorities.
The Council has set up Transformation Programme to identify and deliver the savings required and this contract is intended to secure a strategic partner who will provide support and specialist expertise to the Councils saving/ transformation programme over the MTFS period.
The strategic partner will be required to:
 Assist in devising a longer term savings strategy for the Council covering the MTFS period

We recognise that: • The Sefton Local Plan identifies 11k housing units (all types and classifications) to be built at a rate of circa 650 units per year; • The private and third sector already operate and provide housing at all levels, however supply is in shortfall currently (because of an inadequate supply of land, which the Local Plan will unlock); • Where the Council does elect to lead, develop and deliver housing it will do so with due consideration to each community effecting and after significant appraisal and in consultation with communities. With so much housing demand across the Borough we must act appropriately, considerately, creating pathways and opportunities for our families, our youngest and eldest. The Council faces funding pressures which threaten its ability to provide essential front line public services. It must find new ways of generating funding streams to help continue to deliver essential services, the DevCo will aid this. There are several options, forms and DevCo types that the DevCo could take. The scope currently is limited to a housing development DevCo that will provide housing for sale, transfer or lease depending on the final approved business plan and approved operating model.

The Council’s detailed requirements, including deliverables are defined in the Project Brief in Section 3 of the RfQ document. The work must be completed by the end of September 2016 and within the allocated budget of £45,000.

As local authorities have strived to save money they have paid increasing attention to health and social care and how these services are delivered.  Many services are now commissioned to the private sector and market intelligence suggests that local authorities may be over spending on high cost placements to residential services for adults and children with complex needs.

The context is explained in the Project Brief but a key assumption is that the commercial interests of the service providers are well served in the current environment with gross profit margins of c30%.

Leicestershire County Council is seeking to commission a reputable and suitably experienced consultant to complete a feasibility study to be presented to senior officers by Friday 30th September 2016.

The Framework establishes the terms and conditions under which the customer can enter into contracts for specified services.  It offers high quality research and evaluation service providers under 8 service areas detailed below. These are core areas of activity for BIS.
