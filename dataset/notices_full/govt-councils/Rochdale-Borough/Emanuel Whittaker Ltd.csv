The Framework is split in to 4 main Lots to cover these work streams. To allow for SME bidding opportunities, Lots 1 to 3 are broken down in to 2 sub-lots / value bands. The Lotting Structure is identified as follows:
LOT 1 - Kitchen Installations (1a - Contracts Up to GBP450k, and 1b - Contracts Over 450k).
LOT 2 - Bathroom Installations (2a - Contracts Up to GBP300k, and 2b - Contracts Over 300k).
LOT 3 - Windows and Doors Installations (3a - Contracts Up To GBP200k, and 3b - Contracts Over 200k).
LOT 4 - Communal Door Installations (no value bands).
The main coverage of work required under this Framework will be for installation as supply of materials is covered under a separate Fusion21 procurement exercise for Kitchens, Bathrooms and Windows and Doors. There will be scope however, dependent on individual client requirements, for a supply and install option to be included under this Framework which will be undertaken in the form of a mini competition between Framework partners.",,,"Scotland,North East,Yorkshire and the Humber,North West,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,South East,South West,Wales,Northern Ireland,Any region,London","45300000 39141400 45421151 45211310 45421130 45421100 44221000 39144000 ","Nick Verburg",info@fusion21.co.uk,"Link Road Depot","Link Road Huyton",Liverpool,"L36 6AP","
