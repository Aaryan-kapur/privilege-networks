      Hertfordshire is entering a period of historic growth, with 100,000 more homes, 100,000 more jobs, and a 15% increase in traffic envisaged during the next 15 years. The Council and its partners have a responsibility to plan positively for this, addressing the challenges this creates by shaping this growth to 2031 and beyond. 
      
      To this end, the Council has adopted a number of strategies outlining its response to these challenges, most notably the Local Transport Plan 4. Aiming to achieve a step change in travel behaviour by setting the framework for sustainable development and mode shift in Hertfordshire, its successful delivery requires a unified, collaborative approach both within the Council and with its partners.
      
      The services, refined through market testing, aim to provide the Council and its partners with the breadth of expertise and experience required to ensure 'good growth' in Hertfordshire. 
      
      Ranging from initial spatial planning work through to design and development of major infrastructure, as well as the modelling work, transport appraisals, and environmental assessments required in between, many of the outlined services will sit alongside in-house staff or existing providers.

ORR/CT/16-43/2,Contract,"OFFICE OF RAIL AND ROAD",Awarded,2017-05-12T14:04:14Z,"Research into passengers' awareness of planned disruption","The aim of this study is to update ORR's understanding of passenger awareness of planned rail service disruption including how and when passengers become aware of possessions. 
The consultants is to undertake market research to derive robust quantitative estimates regarding the timing and of level passenger awareness of planned disruption. 
This research will be used to inform our policy on incentivising Network Rail to notify operators sufficiently early regarding planned service disruption. 

Methodology

This is a difficult area requiring expert questionnaire design. A key difficulty is obtaining information regarding passengers that in the event of planned disruption would not travel by rail. We leave it open to applicants to propose their methodological approach, but it should be set out in some detail so that we can assess the robustness of the proposals.

For example, we think that combining the following two approaches has merit in helping estimate passenger awareness levels and timing:
•	Under the first approach, passengers undertaking journeys subject to planned disruption would be interviewed. They would be asked about how and when they became aware of the disruption (and the implications of the disruption for their journey), including when they booked their journey. 
•	A complementary second approach would focus on interviewing people who had recently undertaken an undisrupted rail journey, for representative rail journeys.  This could be either by surveying passengers on undisrupted trains or using an existing panel focusing on people that had recently undertaken an undisrupted train journey. They would be asked general questions about how they plan and book their rail journeys (e.g. via an internet search). The analysis of when and how passengers purchase tickets could also be enhanced with a separate analysis of timing associated with ticket sales data. Potentially, this survey could contain questions related to passengers' recent experience of disrupted train services. These questions could, for example, ask about passengers' behavioural responses to that disruption.   Stated preference surveys might also be used.

The findings from the market research would feed into the analysis to estimate passenger awareness levels about forthcoming possessions.",,,"Any region","79000000 ","peter gamble",peter.gamble@orr.gsi.gov.uk,"One Kemble Street",,London,"WC2B 4AN",England,,,"ORr CT 16-43 Form of Agreement.doc ORR CT 16-43 ITT.doc Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc DISCLAIMER.doc ORR CT 16-43 Form of Tender.doc ",,"Prospective bidders are strongly advised to register their interest on our tendering portal early in order to receive any further notifications regarding this ITT.

The crossing is jointly owned by Cornwall Council and Plymouth City Council who operate the toll bridge.
The Tamar Bridge is managed with the Tamar Ferries crossing at Torpoint by a committee of the Joint Councils.
Tolls are amended via toll revision orders and the increases in tolls are not linked to inflation.
The Tamar Bridge is a suspension bridge with a total length of 642m with a main span of 335m, the deck level being approximately 40m above the River Tamar.
The bridge carries a daily average of 50,000 vehicles.
The bridge was opened in 1961 and at the time of opening was the longest suspension bridge in the UK.
The bridge was strengthened and widened between 1999 and 2002.
Detailed inspections are undertaken on a quarterly basis along with inspections to comply with the requirements of BD 63/07.
The Joint Councils seek to appoint a suitably and demonstrably experienced and accredited organisation to undertake annual structural bridge inspections, to undertake bespoke inspection activities as required, to advise on the occasional passage of abnormal loads and to provide design and other technical advice and support
related to the ongoing maintenance of the Bridge, including the preparation of maintenance works contracts and assisting in the preparation of tender documentation, providing impartial evaluation of tendered bids and providing ongoing contract management support, as may be necessary, in relation to key maintenance and
repair contracts, as may be awarded to third party contractors.
There is also a requirement to undertake the role of Principal Designer, under the 2015 CDM regulations and to carry out inspections on the counterweight towers of the Torpoint Ferries, along with more general inspections of the Torpoint Ferries Civils infrastructure.
The intention is to let an initial four year contract, commencing from January, 2016, with an option for extending the contract by up to a further two years, in one year increments.
The indicative value range, over the maximum possible anticipated life of the contract of 6 years, is estimated to be between £500,000 - £1,500,000.
