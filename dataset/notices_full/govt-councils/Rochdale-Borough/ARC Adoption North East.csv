CUM001-DN413549-08893136,Contract,"Cumbria County Council",Awarded,2019-08-20T14:41:58Z,"Adoption Services: Recruitment and Placement","The number of Cumbria children requiring adoption has been high over the last five years, alongside a local and national decrease in the numbers of approved adopters.  This has resulted in a shortfall in the number of local authority adoption placements available to meet demand.  The council has therefore purchased an increasing number of placements from Voluntary Adoption Agencies.
The provision of a Cumbria Adoption Services Placement and Support Contract delivered by an Adoption Agency shall ensure that effective, efficient and timely adoption placements are made for more Cumbria children.  The service shall recruit and support adopters, working with the Council to match referred children with adopters.  The provider shall make adoption placements for specific cohorts of children, who will be referred by the council.
This service shall be delivered alongside the work of the council's Adoption Service, ensuring an integrated service for adopted children and their families.
Please refer to the service specification for further details.
All clarification questions must be asked via The Chest by Friday 7th June 2019.  All bids must be uploaded via The Chest by 10:00 on Friday 14th June 2019.

This can cause significant problems in the process of forming satisfactory relationships with and attachments to new carers.
The provision of developmental attachment therapy plays a crucial role in helping children and their adoptive families to develop strong lasting relationships and attachments, therefore preventing adoption breakdowns.
Cumbria County Council is commissioning this countywide service to ensure good outcomes for this vulnerable group of children and their adoptive families are achieved and to meet statutory requirements.
This commissioned service shall be delivered alongside the work of the Adoption Support Team, ensuring an integrated service for adopted children and their families.
