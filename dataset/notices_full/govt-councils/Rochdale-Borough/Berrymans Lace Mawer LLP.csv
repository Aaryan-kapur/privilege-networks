"Legal Services Framework",Contract,"Halton Housing Trust",Awarded,2018-04-05T15:59:26Z,"Legal Services Framework","Halton Housing Trust (HHT) sought to establish a framework of multiple service providers to provide legal services to the organisation. The framework covers the following lots:
- Lot 1: Property
- Lot 2: Human Resources and Employment
- Lot 3: Corporate and Funding
- Lot 4: Housing Management

Bidders could bid on one or more lots. The outcome of the tender process was a four year framework agreement and successful bidders will be required to provide a range of legal services to HHT.

The total estimated value of the framework agreement is approximately £400,000 (ex-VAT) over the total duration of the framework based on historical expenditure. The estimated expenditure values are for information only. No guarantees are given, nor are implied as to the value or quantity of business that will be placed with the successful bidders. HHT accepts no liability for any inaccuracies in the estimates provided. 

Award of a position on this framework to any service provider does not guarantee any contracts will be awarded to that service provider. 

If face to face contact is required, this will generally need to be provided at the main HHT office.  Services may also be required wherever HHT has an operational requirement throughout the UK, especially in the areas of Widnes and Runcorn.",,,"North West","79100000 ",,tenders@cirruspurchasing.co.uk,"Waterfront Point, Warrington Road",,Widnes,"WA8 0TD",England,,,,,,01/04/2018,31/03/2022,24/01/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,400000,,26/03/2018,400000,"[Berrymans Lace Mawer LLP|Castle Chambers
