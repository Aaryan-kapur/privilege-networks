OFWAT will agree to an extension where the current supplier (Storetec) cannot operate within this timescale. The successful Supplier must organise their workload to ensure the Material is collected by this date. The Material must be processed by the successful Supplier and accepted into suitable storage facilities that have been identified, visited and agreed with Ofwat. The Supplier has stated that storage will be in Coventry. The Supplier must take their location into account when advising on the service level that they can provide e.g. delivery times to Birmingham and London for both physical and digital data. Please also note that major roadworks are ongoing around both locations. There is no parking available at either the London or Birmingham office. There is on street parking but the successful Supplier will need to make their own arrangements. The successful Supplier must provide details of how catalogue data will be exported along with all existing metadata to the new system. The process must include what checks will be made to ensure no data is lost and that there is a retrieval system for corrupted files. It is essential that the successful Supplier can accept and use the existing bar codes and maintain the link to the relevant catalogue data currently held by the incumbent Supplier or suggest a suitable no or low cost alternative. Catalogue systems must accept and retrieve Welsh language entries. Digital data must be stored and made available securely in line with GDPR requirements and industry best practice. The successful Supplier needs to have suitable systems in place to store digital data securely. It is desirable that the successful Supplier can provide regular checks to ensure no data is lost, that software formats are still accessible.  The successful Supplier must have the capacity to scan documents in accordance with relevant standards and manage increasing levels of digital data, as required. A service level agreement will be required providing the terms and costs for the retrieval and storage of digital data as well as physical records. The successful Supplier must demonstrate that the scanning process from receipt of documents to destruction creates digital records that are BS 10008:2014 compliant.
