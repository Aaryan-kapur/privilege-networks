The Council is proposing to update the planning submission by amending aspects of the planning application and clarifying the design arrangements for the water resources and any impacts and mitigation required.

These design changes require updates to the planning application Design and Access Statement.  There is also a need to update the Environment Statement, Flood Risk Assessment and Planning Statement 

The Council is inviting tenders for the provision of experienced consultants to review the planning application for:
•	Design of systems and structures associated with water supply and maintenance and further evaluation of measures that are required to mitigate possible impacts of the proposals on both existing and additional items as required to support the planning application.
•	Updating all supporting documents in line with changes in planning policy, legislation, statutory requirements & design updates since the initial planning application was submitted in 2011 to the requirements of the Local Planning Authority (LPA).

"2015-IB-Installation Works",Contract,"Marketing Birmingham Ltd",Awarded,2015-05-28T10:13:18Z,"Installation Works for Interconnect Birmingham Wayfinding Products","Interconnect Birmingham is being delivered as part of the ERDF ‘Investing in the City Region’ programme. Marketing Birmingham and Centro are co-funding partners, supported by Birmingham City Council. Key stakeholders are the Birmingham City Centre BIDs, BCC Highways and Planning and Regeneration, Amey (which holds the PFI contract to maintain Birmingham’s highways), Birmingham Cycle Revolution, the Canal and River Trust and The Calthorpe Estate for Edgbaston. Our aim is to contribute to the city’s sense of place, improving the visitor and passenger experience, opening up the city centre by providing seamless integration of the cycle-walk-bus modes of transport, improving access to commerce, visitor attractions, employment and retail. This will be achieved through on-street wayfinding totems at bus stops and key locations on the pedestrian-cycle network.  

Partners Birmingham City Council, Centro and Marketing Birmingham have worked with information designers, product developers and contractors on Interconnect Birmingham over the past four years to audit and analyse wayfinding and orientation information and to integrate this with bus transport information. Twenty-four on-street pedestrian totem products in the city centre were developed and installed in line with the Birmingham City Centre Interchange bus stop totems, creating a first phase comprising ninety-four wayfinding / public transport information totems in the city core. We then installed the second phase of products across the wider city centre, comprising seventy-four wayfinding products for pedestrians and cyclists. We are entering phase 3 of the delivery plan which will result in the Interconnect network being extended along the canals, through the west of the city and into Edgbaston.

Marketing Birmingham plans to appoint a contractor on the NEC3 Engineering and Construction Short Form Contract (April 2013) to provide Installation Works for wayfinding products to enable the Interconnect Birmingham programme to be delivered.

The Bilston Urban Village Strategic Environmental Infrastructure Project will create 2.44 hectares of rehabilitated land and improve the biodiversity of a further 10.76 hectares of land within a network of high quality multi-functional open spaces on brownfield land as part of the 40-hectare Bilston Urban Village development which includes around 400 new homes together with commercial and employment development. The project also includes works to make the land more accessible and increase usage by existing and new communities. Improvements in biodiversity and nature conservation will result in the designation of a Local Nature Reserve.
The project is led by the City of Wolverhampton Council in conjunction with partners that make up the Steering Group (Canal and River Trust, University of Wolverhampton, Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country and The Land Trust). The project began in March 2017 and will end August 2019.

The successful provider will:
•	Design a methodology to carry out the summative assessment that incorporates ERDF requirements, considers ERDF guidance and builds on the Summative Assessment Plan that has already been submitted to the Managing Authority (Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government).

PROC.01.0649,Contract,"Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat)",Awarded,2020-03-11T15:48:45Z,"Meeting regional and national water resources needs: gap analysis of the current strategic infrastructure scheme portfolio","This project is a desk top study. It is a high level review intended to identify potential current and future opportunities. It is not expected to provide detailed cost information; rather, a high level assessment of potential; estimated timescales to implementation; and an indication of costs and benefits with the consideration given to how they may be best funded for the wider public good. 
We can facilitate contacts with the appropriate water resources, flood risk management and navigation leads at the Environment Agency and at Canals and Rivers Trust, but the review of opportunities does not need to be constrained to these parties only; we welcome further insights from consultants with relevant expertise.Identify options considered but not included in the water companies' final WRMPs, which could have wider regional or national benefit.Review unconstrained options lists from relevant WRMPs.Identify any options with benefit of or above 20 Ml/d which did not make it to companies' preferred plans. Review and categorise the reasons for elimination of each scheme; and consider whether a different decision would have been made if the scheme was considered in the regional/national/multi-user interest instead of a single company's.Identify and review opportunities for increasing and sharing resources that might exist outside the public water supply in England and Wales. (Note: for completeness, this task will be supported by the Environment Agency who has committed to provide a high level assessment on water available for further abstraction in England. We'd expect the consultants to form a high level view - informed by discussion with NRW - of water that may be available for abstraction and transfer from Wales).Identify potential partners from sectors outside of public water supply whose assets could have potential to increase water availability (such as - but not limited to - owners of navigation and flood risk management assets). Gather the necessary information on potential options for supply and transfers, and make a high level assessment of feasibility of these options.
This task is envisaged to focus on scoping future opportunities for multi-functional use of flood risk and navigation assets; however, we are also interested in an informed view on any opportunities/options for water resources that might exist currently
Present findings and recommendations in the draft report, to be shared with the steering group and other interested stakeholders including regional water resource groups and partners identified during the review. The report should include a high level assessment of potential for water resources; estimated timescales to implementation; a high level indication of costs and benefits; and a consideration of potential sources of funding outside of the public water sector.Produce final report and hold a dissemination workshop.
