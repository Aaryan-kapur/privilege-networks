The targeted energy efficiency will involve a 60% reduction of the primary energy consumption of Great Moor House. Please note the ITT provides additional information in relation to the technical requirements.
In brief, the solution must have a modelled performance (based on manufacturer information) which can over a year reduce the buildings grid supplied gas and electricity supply from a baseline of 1,578,047 kWh (averagebased on 2013-2016 annual consumption) to 631,219 kWh - a 60% reduction.
DCC have a capital budget of £380,000 to invest in the project. It is considered that it will be necessary to contribute additional investment to achieve the required 60% reduction of the primary energy consumption. DCC proposes that a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) will be established from which the solution provider can secure an income to recover the costs of additional investment also securing an ongoing income stream.
The solution provider will be required to sign a performance guarantee to underpin the financial performance ofthe overall solution.
The estimated project value is made up of £380,000 capital investment from DCC (including EU funding) and an estimate of a total of £1,408,000 (based on 800 kWp of PV producing 640,000 kWh per year and a PPA rateof11p/kWh for 20yrs).",,,"South West","45000000 ","Daniela Pleiss",daniela.pleiss@devon.gov.uk,"County Hall","Topsham Road",Exeter,"EX2 4QD","United Kingdom","+44 1392383000",http://www.devon.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=073e21e8-0e7d-e711-80e3-005056b64545 ",,01/06/2018,30/06/2019,03/04/2018,NO,,No,No,No,Works,1800000,,31/08/2018,0,"[Non-award|Not applicable|NONE||No|No]",,01/09/2018,02/09/2018,"NotApplicable ",

The intention is to retrofit 15 of Exeter City Council (6 homes in Exeter) North Devon Homes (2 homes in North Devon) and Sanctuary Housing (7 homes in Torbay), requiring a single contractor to design, build and guarantee energy and maintenance performance.
This is part of the Zero Energy Buildings Catalyst project, led by Devon County Council, with the three social landlords, Regen and Energiesprong UK as partners and part funded by the European Regional Development Fund.
Energiesprong is the successful Dutch approach to self-financing net zero energy retrofit of homes. Key components of the approach include:
- average annual energy generation is equivalent to consumption per property, or as close as achievable,
- construction time on site is limited, requiring offsite solutions,
- the contractor is required to provide long term guarantee of energy, comfort and maintenance performance,
- residents pay a fixed regular service charge in return for guaranteed comfort - temperature, hot water, power and air quality,
- capital cost is financed by the landlord against guaranteed maintenance savings and service charge income,
- as the market grows to scale, increasing volume and industrialisation of offsite construction enable self-financing retrofit.
Thousands of home retrofits are now being delivered in the Netherlands, without public subsidy. It is the aim of the project partners to prove the concept with this demonstration and, if successful, to bring more properties to market subject to availability of funding.
The total fixed budget for the contract is 1 223 893 GBP including VAT where applicable.

This project is part of an ongoing programme of NMP survey in Devon, grant-aided by Historic England.

Drivers for an NMP project in the Blackdown Hills AONB & East Devon River Catchments are:
•Designated Landscapes (Blackdown Hills AONB, East Devon AONB)
•Relative lack of detailed archaeological survey.
•Land management issues (e.g. catchment scale soil/water management)
•Development pressure (e.g. proposed A30/A303 dualling)

The standard products of NMP are a digital archaeological map with linked archaeological descriptions, and a report synthesising the archaeological results. Analysis of the project results should describe the character, significance, diversity, association and distribution of archaeological sites and landscapes, visible on aerial photographs, within the project area. 

The project results will also be recorded directly onto Devon and Somerset County Councils’ GIS HER layer. The Devon County HER runs on the Exegesis HBSMR platform and the Somerset HER will be on the HEROS system by the time the project is underway. Devon County Council uses ArcView GIS software.

The project will be based at County Hall, Exeter. Workstations for up to two full time project staff will be provided, including PCs, GIS software and access to the Devon HER and supporting digital records. County Hall smartcards will be provided, which will enable access to the staff carpark for 3 days per week (£1 charge per day and space permitting). Remote access to the Somerset (HEROS) HER will be provided, enabling data input directly from County Hall, Exeter. Should a more intensive staff resource be required or suggested, this can be discussed prior to the submission of tender, however space for more than two staff cannot currently be guaranteed.

DCC operate a variety of Service Term Contracts (STCs), which will entail contractors being appointed to become DCC?s nominated provider for each specific discipline throughout Devon.  DCC work with NPS SW to co-ordinate its property maintenance requirements and work commissions will arrive from both NPS SW (on behalf of DCC), and also from DCC premises managers direct.  

It is noteworthy that there is very significant cost pressure throughout Local Government arising from the Comprehensive Spending Review, and Devon County Council are tasked to provide services to the people of Devon which provide the maximum possible value.  The suite of STCs will provide clear business opportunities for the successfully appointed contractor.   Each STC will be awarded on the basis of one contractor per discipline to cover the Devon area, in order to drive value.   This being the case DCC expects to receive highly competitive rate returns.

The STCs will grant the appointed contractor access to a programme of planned business throughout the four year period plus the ability to quote for unplanned reactive maintenance work across Devon.  These STCs will supplement the Maintenance Panel Agreement and the Standing List of Approved Contractors, which are being competed separately in individual Lots through this process.

The contract will be made up of two Lots:

•	Lot 1 - Statutory Health and Social Care Consumer Voice (Local Healthwatch), funded by all three local authorities, with the CCG as a key stakeholder; and
•	Lot 2 - Local Health and Social Care Engagement, with the three local authorities and the CCG all being parties to this element of the contract. Services purchased under this lot will be on a 'call-off' purchase basis only.

By working together, there is greater opportunity for continued service innovation, collaborative working, sharing knowledge, expertise and capacity in order to jointly realise benefits for service users and maintain a sustainable Local Healthwatch function and support community engagement on health and social care issues.

A key to this will be: retaining the strong Healthwatch brand within Devon, Plymouth and Torbay, building on the good work to date; ensuring the public can continue to access Local Healthwatch face-to-face; and sustaining the volunteer base in all three areas, recognising the vital role they play in supporting Local Healthwatch and engaging with their communities.

It is envisaged that the new contract will commence on 1st April 2020.

The solution should also provide Voicemail facilities for SfB users, flexible call queuing, IVR and directory services with speech recognition, whereby callers can ask for a member of staff, or a service by name.
The expected total contract value is between £600,000 and £800,000 this is based on (10) ten year period. Devon County Council (DCC) operates an internal voice/telephone network which comprises 13 Unify Realitis DX TDM PABXs and a Unify dual node OpenScape Voice VOIP platform. These are linked together via proprietary SIP Trunking running across a managed service MPLS network.
The network hosts about 7,000 extensions, spread across approximately 40 sites. Most extensions have an associated DDI number for incoming calls.
DCC has moved to a more flexible method of working and uses a speech recognition directory to send calls to the users' nominated device, whether this is a desk extension, mobile, home line or a handset in a partner's location. This is provided by a dual node Netcall Liberty platform. This platform also provides our voicemail service and some IVR and auto attendant services for some of the smaller contact routes into the authority.
DCC also operates a 60 seat contact centre, based in Tiverton which deals with the majority of incoming calls from the public for Council services. This includes, but is not limited to; Devon Highways, Adult and Children's Social Care, Registrars and General Enquiries. This is based on a Unify Realitis DX PABX with intelligent call routing and reporting provided by OpenScape Contact Centre (OSCC).",,,"South West","79512000 ","Gavin Punchard",gavin.punchard@devon.gov.uk,"County Hall","Topsham Road",Exeter,"EX2 4QD","United Kingdom","+44 1392383000",http://www.supplyingthesouthwest.org.uk,,,,01/09/2017,31/08/2020,02/06/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,600000,800000,08/08/2017,1000000,"[Netcall Telecom Limited|HP1 1BB|||Yes|No]","Miss Beatrice Carr",01/09/2017,01/09/2020,"Open ",

The Council requires a modern service focussed case management system primarily to:
•	Increase potential for improved service user outcomes as well as access to support
•	Reduce administrative burden on front-line staff so that they can maximise efficiency. 
•	Enable production and analysis of data for management to monitor the services and plan future commissioning;
•	To facilitate effective interface with the Police referral system and the MARAC process;
•	Allow for ongoing use of a commissioner owned system, reducing issue that may occur if the service is transitioned to a new service provider in the future. 
•	To enable the LEESAR partner services to access one Case Management System for the delivery of the contract.
The solution will need to be scalable so that other organisations providing domestic and sexual violence and abuse services can use it if required in future and provide open and modern technology such that data can be shared with other agencies with duties in this service area.

This is also to work where necessary with partners or 3rd party suppliers to secure that all new solutions are integrated with our existing infrastructure services. DCC is therefore looking to award a contract to a single supplier to provide a managed service for all the elements to the Committee Suite portfolio.
The supplier will be responsible for supplying and installing the equipment needed to provide the requirements and functionalities including all necessary cabling, switches, mounts, recording equipment and software to the manufacturers' instructions, with minimum disruption and within timescales required around committee meeting dates.
The maintenance and introduction of new solutions must be balanced with both the needs of the Council and the constrains of operations within these rooms as the Committee Suite is a listed building and any alterations may require special permission and for this reason, removal and installation works need to be sympathetic to the listed status and with care and respect for the materials which make up the fabric of the building.
The Committee Suite meets the democratic needs of the Council and consist of 4 Committee Rooms, a Council Chamber an ante room and a Chair's room as well as 2 Political offices.
Also, key to the strategy is that all the technology is easy to operate and access by different devices be reliable and allowing for majority of the rooms to be easily reconfigurable or opened out to make larger spaces to accommodate bigger audiences to meet the needs of the next meeting/presentation.
Initially the audio-visual equipment upgrade is limited to the Daw Room which is the most versatile and utilised spaced and is very much seen as the window into the Council. Therefore, any new solutions will need to match the need of the current technology on the market and be future proofed.
The main issues with this key room are the mix of aging systems and equipment with no clear departmental ownership and a limited in-depth knowledge of audio-visual equipment. This results in only minimal maintenance being possible. This is particularly difficult as the room is used for member meetings which have public attendance and failure of equipment is damaging to the council's reputation and professional image due to the poor performance of the equipment.

There is an increasing body of evidence that having a Model of Practice, a theory-based framework that supports professional practice, is a key factor in developing an effective children's service that supports families and communities.  Devon County Council (DCC) have recently agreed a strategy for adopting a restorative practice approach with motivational interviewing as a tool for working with children and families. DCC will develop our 'in-house' social care workforce, including early help services as well as statutory social work, to be confident and competent in working with children and their families using a restorative practice approach, which will include motivational interviewing as a core intervention for practitioners in their direct work.  

DCC seek to maximise the potential for impact of their service on achieving successful outcomes for children and their families, this will include
•	fewer children in care
•	fewer children subject to child protection plans
•	fewer children in need

This will be achieved  by extending and embedding the practice approach across the wider multi-agency partnership where possible. This may include public health nursing which will become part of DCC managed service from April 2019. 

DCC need to develop skills in using practice tools which enable this approach when working with families. There are many specific or specialist tools that complement a restorative framework. As part of this proposal, alongside the whole service delivery of restorative practice and supervision training and role modelling, DCC will also train practitioners and managers in motivational interviewing. 

Contract Information:
Service Area 1 - Motivational Interviewing 
1a. ½ day Motivational Interviewing awareness raising workshop
1b. 3-day Motivational Interviewing training course
1c. 1-day Motivational Interviewing champions training course

DCC requires a sole supplier for Service Area 1, a sole supplier for Service Area 2 and a sole supplier for Service Area 3 who can deliver all training requirements within that Service Area as specified above. 

Three contracts will be awarded; one for Service Area 1, one for Service Area 2 and one for Service Area 3. More than one Service Area may be awarded to one Supplier.

Therefore in line with the recommendations the Council has developed a new service specification for the delivery of Buildings Based Day Centres. This new specification has lead the Council to take the decision to develop a Preferred Supplier List (PSL).

A PSL is a standing list of providers who have successfully completed and passed this Quality Assurance Questionnaire (QAQ). Providers who are on this list are not guaranteed any work, however they will be the only providers who the Council will directly place individuals. 

The Day Centres which are promoted to the list shall be the only Buildings Based Day Centres in which the Council will directly commission these services with, however there can be no guaranteed number of placements. The Council will use PSL as a method in which we can offer service user choice. The PSL will contain the details of what the Day Centre offers, what the cost of a session is and also any additional optional costs for services they offer.

The Liberty platform also provides a voicemail service and some auto attendant services for some of the smaller contact routes into the authority. DCC also operates a 60 seat call centre, based in Tiverton which deals with the majority of incoming calls from the public for Council services, such as Devon Highways, Adult and Childrens Social Care, Trading Standards. This is based on a Unify Realitis DX PABX with intelligent call routing and reporting provided by OpenScape Contact Centre.

Applications are either submitted via a DfT operated online service or directly G-to the DCC contact centre. DCC assesses each application and determines whether to award a Blue Badge or invite the applicant to a mobility assessment. DCC also undertakes ordering of badges. The current business process is inefficient, relying on paper documents, rekeying of information into an Adult Social Care system, and lacking basic requirements such as customer notifications. DCC is pursuing a digital transformation agenda and has procured the Outsystems low code platform to develop services. The Blue Badge service is the first new digital service to be built on the platform. Development work is scheduled to commence 1st February 2019 and must be completed no later than 31st March 2019.

A discovery exercise involving workshops, user research, etc. has identified user stories the new digital service will ideally meet. The user stories are contained within the product backlog. The list is undergoing constant iteration. It has undergone initial prioritisation but deliverables in relation to the Minimum Viable Product and subsequent releases have yet to be determined.

DCC requires a partner who can lead development of the new Blue Badge digital service. The organisation will have substantial experience of Outsystems and will be capable of meeting complex project requirements. Responsibilities will include leading the development activities within a multi disciplinary team in order to deliver a new blue badge digital service in accordance with the product backlog. This will include but is not limited to sprint planning, estimation, release planning, exploration of technical options, development of digital service using agile (scrum / kanban influenced) approach, versioning, testing, and assigning tasks and assessing output of a junior developer.

The partner's allocated resource will be part of a team that is currently being established but will include the following DCC resources: delivery manager (acting); junior developer (0.5FTE); content designer (0.5FTE); user researcher (0.5FTE equivalent); and technical architect (0.2FTE). The team will be established for 6 x 2-week sprints, corresponding to 12 weeks in total, commencing 14th January 2019 and will be based at County Hall, Exeter.

Therefore in line with the recommendations the Council has developed a new service specification for the delivery of Buildings Based Day Centres. This new specification has lead the Council to take the decision to develop a Preferred Supplier List (PSL). A PSL is a standing list of providers who have successfully completed and passed this Quality Assurance Questionnaire (QAQ). Providers who are on this list are not guaranteed any work, however they will be the only providers who the Council will directly place individuals. The Day Centres which are promoted to the list shall be the only Buildings Based Day Centres in which the Council will directly commission these services with, however there can be no guaranteed number of placements. The Council will use PSL as a method in which we can offer service user choice. The PSL will contain the details of what the Day Centre offers, what the cost of a session is and also any additional optional costs for services they offer.

Buildings based day services will be of value as a meeting point, for providing a flexible 'drop-in' for people at times of their choosing, for providing access to facilities suitable for people with disabilities (i.e. toilets and kitchen areas, meeting rooms), for providing a access point for information advice and signposting, for providing spaces for one to one support and small group activities. But as much as possible the building should take the form of an ordinary facility, preferably one that can be used by anyone in the community, regardless of whether or not they have health or disability related difficulties and located within and with easy access to, community services and facilities. Furthermore buildings based services will increasingly provide a space, facilities and support to people who are attending activities run by external voluntary and community groups and other organisations. Incidental to the provision of meaningful activity for people attending buildings based day services, services can also provide respite for carers. The ability to offer person centred activities for a whole day or half day with integrated support and if necessary care, can allow carers to take a significant break from caring responsibilities. Increasingly people who receive social care funding wish to take up mainstream social and cultural opportunities, and to build broader social networks. They want to receive support and partake in activities that are personalised around their needs and theirs and their carers wishes. Traditional services have been less effective in enabling these sorts of opportunities. Building-based services have a role to play in supporting people to maintain and extend social networks and access to mainstream roles and activities. This specification describes the Councils approach to modernised buildings based day services. This Specification is not related to a community enabling or community facilitation offer, whereby a number of hours of support which enables or facilitates access and use of services and activities open to all (universal services).
