"Awarded - RFQ 13772310,1/2",Contract,"Lancashire County Council",Awarded,2017-02-15T11:36:56Z,"Flexible Agreement for Learning Disability Supported Living Services - Transforming Care - PAN Lancashire","In line with the national Transforming Care Agenda Lancashire County Council (LCC) has been working closely in partnership with the Lancashire Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and Blackpool, and Blackburn with Darwen local authorities, to consider the provision required for people with learning disabilities and/or autism who display behaviour that challenges, including those with a mental health condition  and require a placement in the community following an in-patient stay or to prevent an in-patient admission.

Due to the estimated discharges in the next 12 months within the Pan-Lancashire area, a Flexible Agreement has been developed. This is intended to be an interim agreement and will initially be in place for one year with the option to extend for up to a further three years if required.  This is to allow the time to develop further commissioning options for Transforming Care whilst allowing us to have an initial agreement in operation as early as October 2016, to allow Transforming Care placements to be commissioned with suitably selected providers via this Flexible Agreement.
Social value has been considered throughout the development of the service specification and is part of the evaluation methodology.
Please note that the original RFQ in relation to this tender has been amended due to a revision to the selection criteria in relation to CQC ratings.

LCC requires a Provider to be registered with CQC for the regulated activity of Personal Care by the tender deadline of the 12th August 2016 however if a Provider nominates an office that is currently unrated as it has not yet been inspected by CQC then your Submission will not be disregarded on that basis, however at the point when the office has its first inspection you must inform the lead officer immediately and your nominated office must meet the requirements of either outstanding, good or requires improvement (latter with robust justification). Prior to contract award where the status of your nominated office does not meet the requirements for the Flexible Agreement your Submission will be disregarded. Following contract award if any provider is given an overall rating of requires improvement or inadequate for the nominated office the Contracting Body reserves the right to suspend/terminate the agreement depending on its own judgement.  

The RFQ on the e-tendering system has been amended to reflect this along with all the tender documents. The tender deadline will be extended to the 12/08/16 to allow providers sufficient time to consider submitting a bid having taken into account the revised criteria.",,,"North West","85000000 ","Joanne Sherborne",joanne.sherborne@lancashire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Christ Church Precinct","County Hall",Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"01772 531427",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41137&e=e ","Please Note:  Value of Contract

Lancashire County Council (LCC) believes that as many CYP with SEND as is possible should be able to access and enjoy short break services. The service will be available to service users who live in Lancashire (excluding Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool). The service is commissioned during school holidays.

The service seeks to improve outcomes for both CYP and their parents and carers. The service advocates that parents and carers are supported in their caring role and those CYP with SEND are supported to engage in life enriching activities and to socialise with their peers in a safe and comfortable environment.

The value of the Framework for the initial period of 12 months is approximately £1,000,000. The Framework may be extended for a further 6 months subject to the conditions set out in the ITT and contractual documents.
