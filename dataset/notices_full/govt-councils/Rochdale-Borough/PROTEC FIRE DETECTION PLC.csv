"STC1105 - AWARD",Contract,"Parliament UK",Awarded,2016-01-14T11:44:48Z,"STC1105 - Supply and Maintenance of AFD and VAS Equipment - AWARD","The Houses of Parliament (HoP) require to upgrade the Automatic Fire Detection (AFD) and Voice Alarm Systems (VAS) for approximately 15 buildings on the Parliamentary Estate. This programme requires a solution providing both AFD and VAS equipment that consultants and contractors to the HoP may specify and/or use to deliver upgraded AFD and VAS installations within the HoP Estate.
The Parliamentary Estate is protected by AFD and VAS in varying stages of their lifecycle. Improvement projects within a wider programme of work, some aligning with general refurbishment projects, are being developed to upgrade these systems. 
The purpose of this particular Contract Opportunity is to approach the AFD and VAS market with a view to selecting a suitable supplier to standardise hardware and software across the whole estate and achieve more efficient supply, working, and operation of the systems. 
Products offered as a solution will be current and be supported with a commitment to maintaining that product as a current and/or available offering within an agreed cost structure for the period of the contract.
It is envisaged that a supply contract may run for a period of up to a maximum of ten years save that the HoP shall reserve a right to terminate the contract at intermediate points to be specified within the maximum contract period. The initial contract period is anticipated to be seven years with options to extend on one or more occasions to a maximum of a further 3 years. The estimated value of the supply element is £8,000,000 and £12,000,000.
An initial maintenance contract is anticipated to be four years in the first instance with options to extend one or more occasions to a maximum of a further 6 years.
The estimated value of maintenance at £2,400,000 is a cumulative total rising from £0 in year one.
A supplier of such systems to the HoP is expected to be able to deliver a solution which offers:
•	An outline design suitable for the whole estate
•	Continuity of supply for a period of up to 10 years
•	Confidence as to ongoing product support, operation, maintenance, and resilience into the future from the point of supply, whether year 1 or subsequent periods of the supply contract
•	A demonstrable commitment that the installed hardware and software will be  supported for the expected working life of the system once installed
•	A contract for the supply of a solution on pre-agreed terms that may be installed either by the supplier and/or other contractors appointed by the HoP
•	Scope for working with the HoP project designers
•	Open communication protocols that provide the ability to connect to site management operation software and other third party systems such as Lift, Building Management, Security, CCTV, and Access Control Systems. 
•	The ability to interface with installed plant/machinery and other fire related equipment /systems to effect controlled actions in the event of an incident
•	Be able to m...",,"SW1A 0PW",London,"31625200 48952000 50700000 31625100 ","Parliamentary Procurement & Commercial Service  Commercial Servi",ppcs@parliament.uk,"7 Millbank",London,London,"SW1A 0PW","United Kingdom",02072191600,,,,,07/01/2016,06/01/2026,07/04/2015,NO,,No,No,No,Products,10400000,14000000,16/12/2015,8000000,"[Protec Fire Detection plc|Churchill Way, Lomeshaye Industrial Estate, Nelson, Lancashire, United Kingdom, BB9 6RT|||No|No]",,07/01/2016,06/01/2026,"Restricted ",
