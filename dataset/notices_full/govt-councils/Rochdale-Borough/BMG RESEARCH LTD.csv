PROC.01.0641,Contract,"Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat)",Awarded,2020-02-26T14:38:27Z,"Non-Household Customer Insight Survey","The overall objective of the work is to help Ofwat build its understanding of the functioning of the water business retail market through gauging the experiences and views of eligible business customers and - through aspects of the qualitative work - brokers and third party intermediaries. The priorities, views and experiences of customers (including organisations working on their behalf) are essential in understanding whether, and how, the market is functioning effectively and delivering for customers. This evidence will also help us assess industry's progress in resolving previously identified 'market frictions'.
The key objectives of this research are to better understand three key aspects by undertaking the following actions:
1. Monitoring the experiences and views of eligible business customers, including the extent to which they are aware of the market, have chosen to engage with the market, their needs and expectations have been met, and the reasons for these outcomes - and the trends in these views, by making comparisons to the 2017/18 and 2019 quantitative customer research.
2. Exploring in more depth the experiences of the small to medium enterprise (SME) group of eligible business customers, the outcomes experienced across this SME group and their perceptions of the business retail market.
3. Reviewing, and assessing the roles and views of brokers and third party intermediaries (TPIs) in the business retail market, including the extent to which they are involved, different business models in practice and how they interact with customers of varying size. In addition, their views about how well the market works for the customers they work on behalf of, and retailers in general and where and why it could work better.
The research outputs will feed into two key areas:
- Firstly, they will provide an evidence base for future policy development and delivery, helping Ofwat and other industry participants (e.g. the market operator (MOSL)) to judge where further action may be needed to enable the business retail market deliver improved outcomes for customers.
Secondly, the results will form a key part of our third annual 'State of the Market' report, which will review the market for the year 2019/20. As such, the outputs of the customer research work must be clear, comprehensive and robust, and comparable with quantitative customer research results for 2017/18 and 2019.
We think objectives 1 and 3 will be reached through quantitative research, with qualitative research to inform objectives 2 and 3.
Accordingly, the results of the quantitative aspects of the research must be statistically robust and comprehensive enough for us to identify where the market is delivering or not delivering for customers, and the reasons why. The results of the qualitative aspects of the research should shed further light on perceptions of where and why the market is working well or if there are areas which need to work better.",,,"West Midlands,London","79411000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gov.uk,Birmingham,,Birmingham,B54UA,England,,,,,"For Further Information,please contact procurement@ofwat.gov.uk",06/11/2019,14/04/2020,07/10/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,138050,,05/11/2019,138050,"[BMG Research Ltd|Beech House

The contract is until 30 April 2020 (to enable the Supplier to finalise its assessment and deal with queries) with the potential to complete a further year of research, should the Customer deem this is required. 
• Engaging with Ofwat and stakeholders via the Working Groups and sub-groups as and when necessary. This may include running workshops; engaging with Ofwat and stakeholders via the Working Groups and sub-groups as and when necessary;
• assessing the outcomes of the surveys and compiling of the C-MeX and D-MeX scores; 
• familiarising themselves with the areas of work referenced in this document including keeping up to date with policy developments in these areas, which may include liaising with relevant stakeholders or running workshops; and engaging with Ofwat and stakeholders via the Working Groups and sub-groups as and when necessary;
• providing feedback to Ofwat on the shadow year process and outcomes, and, if necessary, recommendation for C-MeX and D-MeX methodology based on findings. The final incentives will be run by Ofwat. All decisions on the final design of C-MeX and D-MeX will remain for Ofwat.
• In conjunction with stakeholders and Ofwat, developing the final guidance that companies will need to follow when C-MeX and D-MeX become operational.
Suppliers are to provide costings for the sample sizes set out in the sections below for each incentive, as well as alternative sample sizes, based one of the following services:
•	Completion of surveys for C-MeX only; 
•	Completion of surveys for D-MeX only; and 
•	Completion of surveys for both C-MeX and D-MeX 

C-MeX and D-MeX are primarily mechanisms to incentivise better service. They are not designed to be diagnostic tools or replacements for companies to engage with their customers. Nonetheless we expect that the process will provide companies with insight on, and the opportunity to make, service improvements. We made a decision to run the shadow year from 1 May 2019 to 31 March 2020, making the duration of the shadow year 11 months only. Although the shadow year is 11 months in length, we would like the Supplier to assume that the scope of the work is the same as if the shadow year was 12 months in duration. We leave it to the Supplier to adjust the scope of work across the 11 months of the shadow year.
