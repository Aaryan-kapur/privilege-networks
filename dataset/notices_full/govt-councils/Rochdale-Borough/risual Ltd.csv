At the most basic level, identity management involves defining what users can do on the network with specific devices and under what circumstances. At UCA there is a wide range of requirements that need to be managed and identity management will enhance security by providing a single definition point.

The program aims to implement identity in achievable, sequenced projects to achieve its goals. 

The goals of the project will be:

•	To rationalise user access to systems and provide one single login.
•	To improve security by providing a single gate into the systems
•	To retire systems and procedures that create vulnerabilities when accessing the network
•	To utilize office 365 which also provides user storage. This will reduce the demand for space on the network and reduce the backup requirement",,"GU9 7DS","South East","72245000 72232000 ","Sadie Rowe",procurement@ucreative.ac.uk,"Falkner Road",,Farnham,"GU9 7DS",England,"01252 892715",www.ucreative.ac.uk,"FINAL UCA Tender Document ID Management Iss.1.docx FINAL Tender Questions Mar 16.pdf ",,"OJEU contract notice: 000070680 refers
