Effective treatment and recovery requires a range of services and interventions including; specialist clinical services offering opiate replacement treatment, stabilisation and reduction programmes, medically assisted alcohol withdrawal programmes, psychosocial interventions and support, non-structured support including mutual aid, harm reduction services, including needle and syringe programmes and referral pathways to related health and social care services as well as residential rehabilitation programmes.

Sefton Council are inviting expressions of interest from established Service Providers to join a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for selection and commissioning of Residential Substance Misuse Rehabilitation Services. The Council are looking to commission rehabilitation placements at three levels, Standard, Enhanced and Specialist and Service Providers are invited to submit bids against one or more levels.

Requirements and criteria for service provision at each of these levels is outlined in detail throughout the enclosed Service Specification. It is anticipated that prospective Service Providers will describe their experience and capability in providing these services at one or more of the levels described. 
Introduction 

With effect from 1st October 2017 Sefton Council established a Dynamic Purchasing System (D.P.S.) for the provision of Residential Substance Misuse Rehabilitation Services. 

The reason the Council opted to pursue a D.P.S. was to enable the Council to remain in touch with this marketplace on a greater frequency than would be permissible under a Framework. 

The Council informed the marketplace in 2017 that once established the Council intended to re-open the opportunity for any potential providers that may have either :

a)	joined this marketplace since the DPS was established, or 

b)	were in this market place when the DPS was established, did not opt to bid at the time of formation,  but have since developed an interest in providing services to the Council


The Council intended to re-open the DPS to any further potential Service Providers for approximately 2 weeks on the following dates :


a)	1st September 2018

b)	1st September 2019


The Council is now opening the 2nd Anniversary window. The 1st of September 2019 falls on a non working day, but also considering staff resource at the Council, it has opted to open it on 27th August 2019.",,,"North West","85144000 ","Chris Magee",chris.magee@sefton.gov.uk,"1st Floor Magdalen House","Trinity Road",Bootle,"L20 3NJ",England,"+44 1519344069",http://www.sefton.gov.uk/,,,,24/09/2019,31/03/2020,10/09/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,800000,800000,28/10/2019,800000,"[Littledale Hall Therapeutic Community|LA2 9EY|NONE||Yes|No][Shardale Ltd|FY8 2NW|NONE||Yes|No][Liverpool YMCA|L3 6HU|NONE||Yes|Yes][Phoenix Futures|SE1 6DF|NONE||No|No][Good News Family Care (Homes) Limited|SK17 6PT|NONE||Yes|No][Holgate House|BB9 6AB|NONE||Yes|No][Acorn Recovery Projects|BB11 2ED|NONE||Yes|No]","Mr Keith Robertson",01/11/2019,31/03/2020,"Open ",
