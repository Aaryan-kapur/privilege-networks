      The service will provide on-site 24/7 care and support, aimed at enabling older people to live independently.
      Estimated Contract Value - £2,681,000  (£383,000 per annum)
      Contract Start - 28 February 2017
      Contract Expiry - 27 February 2021
      Contract Duration - 4 years with the option of 3 x 1 year extensions (to a maximum of 7 years (to 27/02/2024)
      
      Service Requirement - 
      Alexandra House is a 39 bedded supported accommodation unit predominantly for older people requiring care and support needs located in Henley Green, Coventry.  
       
      The Council is tendering the provision of care and support at this unit, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  The aim of the service is to enable older people to live as independently for as long as possible through the provision of flexible care and support services.
       
      The requirement will cover both short term and long term placements. Provision will need to meet fluctuating demand for short term and long term care alongside responding to the changing needs of local people. Therefore the service will be required to operate flexibly across short term intensive support for people to recover from illness, preventing hospital admission (step up) or from a period of hospitalisation (step down) to regain their independence and long term support in order to meet ongoing social care needs.  With regard to short term this will include therapy support to enable people to achieve their full potential, the therapy will be arranged and supplied by the City Council. 
       
      Payment is based on meeting the number of assessed care and support hours required by tenants. In the last 6 months the average assessed weekly hours for the scheme is approximately 450 hours which equates to 11.5 hours per person (based on long term placements only). These hours are likely to fluctuate as needs change for tenants.
       
      The current registered social landlord for Alexandra House is Anchor.  The incoming provider will be required to set up licence/lease/co-operation arrangements directly with Anchor for the use of this building, as specified within this tender document.",,"CV1 2PW","West Midlands","85320000 ","Coventry City Council Procurement Team",procurement.services@coventry.gov.uk,"New Union Street",Coventry,Coventry,"CV1 2PW","United Kingdom","024 7683 3757",,,,,28/02/2017,27/02/2021,28/11/2016,NO,,No,No,No,Services,2298000,2298000,27/04/2017,0,"[Making Space|Lyne House, 46 Allen Street, Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom, WA2 7JB|||No|No]","Wyn  Jones",28/02/2017,27/02/2021,"Open ",
