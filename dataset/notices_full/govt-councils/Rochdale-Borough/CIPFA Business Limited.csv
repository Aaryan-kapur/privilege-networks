"TS16023 Award",Contract,"Derbyshire County Council",Awarded,2018-01-25T13:53:13Z,"TS16023 - Supply of an Internally Hosted Asset and Facilities Management Solution with Associated Services","The Council is looking to procure a single Internally Hosted Asset and Facilities Management Solution with Associated Services for its Corporate Resources Property Division, to facilitate efficient management of its land and property portfolio. 

The Solution needs to provide Asset Management and Facilities Management functions including collection and retention of common property data and health and safety and statutory compliance data. It needs to be flexible, suitable for a Local Authority client, user friendly and able to interface with other software packages such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping systems, and potentially Building Information Modelling (BIM) software.

The Solution needs to be web enabled and accessible from any Council location despite varying levels of mobile network coverage. It will be internally hosted within the Council's own data centres.

Associated Services include, but are not limited to: implementation; data migration; support and maintenance; training and skills/knowledge transfer; and account management.

Tenderers must note that benchmarking indicates this requirement can be delivered below the OJEU threshold of £164,176. Therefore, any submissions that do not fall below this figure for the Total Contract Value, including optional requirements and possible extensions, will be deemed non-compliant.

The initial contract period is 4 years, with options to extend on an annual basis to take the term up to a maximum of 7 years.",,,"East Midlands","48000000 72000000 ",,shane.linthwaite@derbyshire.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Matlock,"DE4 3AG",England,,,,,,01/10/2017,30/09/2021,23/02/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,NotSpecified,86000,150000,20/07/2017,149800,"[CIPFA Business Limited|The Quadrant
