The site currently accommodates a visitor attraction which celebrates both the Borough's glass heritage and wider social history. The priority is to establish a library within the current building footprint without any significant internal reconfiguration. On the ground floor, the Library will occupy a discrete area (circa 219m2). This space will accommodate a lending library and on the mezzanine level, a computer suite with printing facilities.  Space in the building is at a premium and the ambition is to allow for spaces to be reconfigured to allow a variety of uses.  St Helens Library Service does not currently have any self-service facilities and is looking to install an RFID-enabled self-service kiosk for St Helens Library users to check out and return books without library staff intervention.

In the remaining libraries, stock will be tagged and self service kiosks installed for immediate go live. TAO will be installed at the same time (except in possibly two libraries) and tested so libraries only need to close once. However it is planned not to go live with TAO until the public are use to self service kiosks, including the initial install in Binfield Library. Because of the uncertainly around Bracknell library, the install and implementation in this library will be last. However it is not expected that there will be any additional costs beyond what has been included in the tender to provide self service kiosks and TAO in the current Bracknell library building. Necessary building works will be undertaken by the Council as well as power cabling. Some of these works will occur at the same time as the install of the self service kiosks and TAO. An option for the bidder to undertake the data cabling has been included in the tender. The bidder is required to provide detailed cabling diagrams for both power and data as part of this tender. Floor plans for the nine libraries have been provided showing proposed location of self service kiosks, and the location of the counter and public PCs. Site surveys to enable the tender to be completed are by prior arrangement and should take place between 25th May to 9th June 2017.
