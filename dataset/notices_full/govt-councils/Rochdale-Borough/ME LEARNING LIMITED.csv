"CQC LD 197a",Contract,"Care Quality Commission",Awarded,2020-03-04T13:51:12Z,"National Guardian eLearning Package","•	The National Guardian's Office (NGO) wishes to procure an e learning package that will address the initial foundation and ongoing training needs of an expanding group of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians in England.  The aim is to provide an engaging and compelling, high impact, accessible training product that instils understanding about the Freedom to Speak Up agenda and the role of the Freedom To Speak Up Guardian in providing an alternative route to speaking up.  

•	The NGO is currently supporting in excess of 500 FTSUGs across England and across the health sector as a whole.  The package will replace the current foundation training which is a 1-day face to face session and will enable training at scale and appeal to Guardians in a wide range of providers.  The majority of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians currently are in NHS trusts and Foundation trusts and the new E-Learning will need to reflect the direction of travel towards a fully integrated approach across the patient pathway applicable to Guardians in secondary care, primary care i.e. GP, optometry, pharmacy and dentistry, regulators and other non-provider organisations e.g. arms' length bodies.  It will be available on the new NGO website.

•	The e-learning will be the main part of the training (Part 1) and will be followed up with an interactive face to face session in the form of an Action Learning Set or similar facilitative discussion (Part 2).  It is intended that the learning should be modular in nature and each element capable of standing alone, which it is hoped will also answer the need for Guardians to undertake annual refresher learning.

•	We would want to work in close collaboration about the content and design of the e-learning but input and expertise will be sought and welcome from the successful supplier
