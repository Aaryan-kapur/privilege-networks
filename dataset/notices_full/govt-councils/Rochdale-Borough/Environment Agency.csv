The market town of Chester-le-Street has a history of flooding with recent major events occurring in 1979, 1996 and 2012 with local residential property, businesses and infrastructure significantly affected. Current formal flood defences protect the town of Chester-le-Street from flooding from the Cong Burn, these defences consist of a flood wall along Pelton Fell Road and a primary screen which is situated upstream of a long culvert, allowing the Cong Burn to flow through the main town centre and market place. 
 
The key benefits from a scheme will be through the reduction in flood risk to residential properties, non-residential properties, and infrastructure in Chester-le-Street town centre. 
 
Included within the scope of works is the:
•	Daylighting of 90 metres of twin bore culvert and providing a significant 'blue green' corridor in the current area of the market place;
•	Provision of landscaping, footpaths and seating areas in the new 'blue green' space for public use;
•	Extension of the existing wall by 10 metres in length and building of a new earth bund adjacent to Pelton Fell Road upstream of the culvert inlet.
 
The completed work will benefit the businesses located around the Cong Burn, it will also benefit residents in the area. The public will benefit from an improved and safer environment, free from significant flood risk and ensuring the local highways remain open and safe for all network users. 

Flood prevention works have already taken place by Northumbrian Water, the Environment Agency and Durham County Council. However, further work is needed to reduce flood risks in the longer term in this area.

Funding

At present the Council has submitted an application for funding to ensure the delivery of the scope and achievement of the strategic objectives for this flood mitigation scheme from a range of sources including ERDF (European Regional Development Fund), Environment Agency funding in the form of Local Levy and Flood Defence Grant in Aid (FDGiA) and Durham County Council.

Should the Council be unsuccessful in obtaining all funding the Project may be modified accordingly, (unless an alternative funding source is identified).  Progression of this procurement exercise and any award of this contract opportunity will be conditional on confirmation of sufficient funds being available and/or modification of the Project.

The area is served by the Pool watercourse and a combined drainage system. During periods of heavy rainfall, the drainage systems that are combined are known to back up leading to surface water and foul flooding. This was evidenced during storm Desmond and storm Eva in December 2015 when a number of properties in Verulam Road, Marlewood Avenue and Balmoral Drive were flooded and the highway affected causing traffic disruption.
In 2016/17, Sefton Borough Council secured funding from the Environment Agency to investigate the condition, capacity and connectivity of the Pool Watercourse which runs through these areas. Initial investigations have identified that the culverted section of the watercourse had silted up in large sections and has structurally deteriorated. 
With the information gathered to date the Council is looking to appoint a competent consultant to develop a long list of options which should then be assessed and modelled into a short list of options, with a preferred option being designed. The consultant will be required to provide information to the employee to enable them to easily submit a business case to the Environment agency to secure funding to undertake the scheme.

The Department’s Group Property Board lead on property matters across DfT and Agencies.  Property matters on five themes are coordinated through the Property Group Operating Model, with one theme being Facilities Management (FM).  The general principle is for all parties to coordinate, share best practice, and to seek efficiencies by acting as one and aggregating activity, resources and spend.
The DfT Group has four principal Total Facilities Management (TFM) contracts, plus a collection of smaller arrangements in-place for BTP.  The proposal is to replace all of these with a single contracted FM model (‘The Service Model’) to serve all estates.  The contract(s) are to be procured from the mandated CCS FM Framework ; that is one procurement for many.
The Government Property Shared Services Programme (PSSP) has allied The Department with DEFRA.  DEFRA is constrained under their current FM provision until 2024, yet one of their agencies (The Environment Agency) is available to join subject to internal governance and Cabinet Office approvals.

The Authority operates eight waste landfill sites throughout the county of Lancashire. The leachate collection and treatment systems at each site are designed to collect and/or collect and treat leachate prior to its discharge to foul sewer. A leachate is any liquid that has passed through materials and has extracted solutes, suspended solids or any other component of the material through which it has passed. In this case the leachates extract components from the landfill waste and thus become harmful to the environment and may give rise to explosive atmospheres within the public sewer network unless it is suitably treated.  
 
The performance of the Council's landfill drainage treatment systems is regulated by United Utilities Plc and the Environment Agency. The Authority has a responsibility to manage closed landfill sites as well as enforcing environmental standards, as per various legislative requirements such as Environmental Protection Act 1990, Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 and Water Industry Act 1991. Therefore it is important that the systems designed to achieve these responsibilities are effectively cleaned and maintained.

"P/REF 00000886 - AWARD",Contract,"English Heritage-Estates",Awarded,2018-07-09T11:54:45Z,"Stonehenge Water Management  - AWARD","Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, approximately 2 miles west of Amesbury and 8 miles north of Salisbury. One of the most famous sites in the world, Stonehenge is the remains of a ring of standing stones set within earthworks. It is in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds. 
      
      The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 in a co-listing with Avebury Henge. It is a national legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage. Surrounding land is owned by the National Trust. 
      
      A new visitors centre, located at Airman's Corner approximately 1.3 miles from the stones, opened in December 2013. The centre houses permanent and temporary exhibitions, as well as a gallery, a gift shop, café, office space and toilet facilities. Also located on site is an ancillary building with site offices and essential services equipment. Given the distance between the coach drop off zone and the visitor centre toilet facilities, a new toilet block was built and commissioned in 2017. 
      
      Under the provisions of an Environment Agency abstraction consent, the potable water supply (PWS) on site is provided by a private borehole. It is subsequently treated for nitrogen and pathogen removal prior to storage and distribution. A second borehole provides the heating and cooling energy required for the ground source heating and cooling system (GSHC). This is an open loop system with the abstracted water being returned to a third borehole. 
      
      In an effort to reduce the volume of water abstracted for use on site, a n activated sludge membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater treatment plant is designed to treat wastewater to an extremely high standard in order that it may be re-used in the two toilet blocks for toilet flushing. As a secondary means of discharge, treated effluent may also be dispersed to a soakaway for infiltration to groundwater. 
      
      Vacuum drainage systems (VDS) installed at both toilet blocks reduce the volume of water required for each flush. 
      Whilst all of these systems are independent systems, they all work together to achieve the provision, distribution and treatment of water on site. Historically, these systems have been managed and operated independently without cross-communication between O&M providers, which has not allowed for the optimisation of their operation or the efficiencies afforded by bringing the management of these systems under a single point of operation responsibility. 
      
      As a part of three year cycle, English Heritage are re-visiting the operation and maintenance contracts that manage the potable water, ground source heating/cooling, vacuum drainage and the wastewater treatment plant. Given the critical importance of delivering safe drinking water, protection of the environment and the challenges of complian...",,"SN2 2EH","South West","31161400 45259100 42122161 45232430 45252210 45252120 45252127 ","Stuart Kenhard",stuart.kenhard@english-heritage.org.uk,"Firefly Avenue","Firefly Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 2EH","United Kingdom",,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/english-heritage/aspx/Home,,,,01/08/2018,31/03/2021,26/04/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,525000,09/07/2018,409067,"[Nijhuis Industries|Nanjerrick Court, Allet, United Kingdom, TR4 9DJ|NONE||No|No]","Brian Scheffe",01/08/2018,31/03/2021,"Restricted ",

Based in Cambridge it has, for over 60 years, undertaken the majority of Britain's scientific research on and around the Antarctic continent.  BAS operates three bases in the Antarctic, at Rothera, Halley and Signy, and two stations on South Georgia, at King Edward Point and Bird Island. BAS liaises with the Environment Agency in the UK, regarding trans-frontier shipment authorisations.  Waste from BAS bases is generally exempt from these requirements.

Approximately 300m3 (between 100-200 tonnes) of hazardous and non-hazardous waste from all BAS stations is segregated on site and sent to the UK on the two ships RRS Ernest Shackleton and RRS James Clark Ross.  The amount of waste varies annually dependent on the science undertaken and any construction projects carried out during the season.  The ships return to the UK typically between May and July each year and the waste is off-loaded and sent for reuse, recycling or other disposal in accordance with the waste hierarchy.

The work will require the contractor to provide bespoke waste management services involving the collection, transportation and disposal of waste generated at BAS stations and offloaded at ports in the UK, typically Immingham or Grimsby but could include others such as Portland, Ipswich, Southampton or Harwich. 

A key element of the contract is to be able to provide a flexible service for which the collection location, waste types and quantities may change at short notice.

Ensure best practice survey/ questionnaire design from the Office for National Statistics - to meet project milestones, we need to carry out a questionnaire survey and issue a data request on the impact of rewilding of water courses on fish/ salmonids in the UK. As a Government Agency we need to ensure best-practice design, layout and construction of the survey/ questionnaire. We had not originally budgeted for this work. The most efficient way to complete this task was to sub-contract the Office for National Statistics.

 2. Provide additional modelling work on flows and salmonids - original milestones relied on salmonid data available from the Environment Agency. However, we are now also collaborating with Queen Mary College, University of London (QMUL) and the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT). GWCT have provided us with much more spatially comprehensive data than that available from the EA, from sampling programmes in catchments of interest to our study, including extensive data for the River Frome and additional data for the Welsh Dee. We were also alerted to the existence of supplementary flow data from Natural Resources Wales, from gauging stations not within the National River Flow Archive. We are working closely with GWCT and QMUL to ensure consistency across methods for analysing relationships between salmonid populations and river flow. This collaboration, along with the enhanced data provided, will allow us to perform more detailed analyses of a wider range of criteria, which will deliver added value and be highly applicable to the Defra Catchment Based Approach policy framework.

Our Flood and Coastal Risk Management (FCRM) Asset Management Strategy 2017 to 2022 (AMS) aligns to the FCRM objectives of our corporate plan and describes what we need to do to become a world leading AM organisation. 

Our AMS was approved by FCRM Business Board in January 2017.  We are achieving many of the objectives of the strategy already but there is some new work still to complete, including developing staff skills and knowledge.  A significant part of our strategy describes our objectives for our staff skills and knowledge, and our leadership and organisational culture.

We need to raise awareness of AM and embed it amongst our people who work on our assets.  We wish to adopt an AM culture within the organisation and this will require enhanced knowledge of AM, and committed and visible leadership.  This will build on existing capabilities and enable individuals to champion change, support the use of new terminologies and language, and drive the modernisation of AM.  We will then be capable of making the changes needed to modernise AM and retain ISO55001 certification.

In order to recognise and demonstrate individual and corporate knowledge and understanding of AM, we wish to train and inform our key AM staff to IAM Certificate level.  The IAM Certificate is aimed at Managers, Team Leaders, Senior Advisors and Advisors in Area and National roles. By training our staff in modern AM thinking we will be able to better justify, prioritise and programme where we spend our money and where we don't, and ensure our assets are more effective, efficient and resilient.

Previous demand for the IAM Certificate has been significant and we have a backlog of delegates seeking training.  Area teams have organised ad-hoc, local training which, whilst meeting the objectives, is inefficient.  We therefore wish to instigate a 3-year call-off contract to provide the IAM Certificate training and examination for approximately 90 FCRM AM staff.  The contract will start in late 2019 and end at the end of the current AMS period in March 2022.",,,"Any region","80531200 ",,Network.Procurement@defra.gov.uk,Defra,,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,0,,"27532_Contract Award Letter_Redacted.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ","

These are a:

•	Water Cycle Study; and
•	Strategic Flood Risk Assessment Level 1 (with the scope of the study increasing to Level 2 assessment, if or where required).

Purpose of Assignment One:	The aim of the Water Cycle Study (WCS) is to ensure that water infrastructure can be managed sustainability alongside the expected growth of the District and will not ultimately constrain the new Local Plan. It is expected that the professional partner will look at:

•	water resources and supply systems;
•	water quality and Water Framework Directive status;
•	foul water sewerage and treatment provision including foul network capacity;
•	surface water drainage; and
•	flood risk management/mitigation (linking where appropriate to assignment two)

Purpose of Assignment Two
The Council requires a new Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) principally to inform the preparation of a new Local Plan.  The new SFRA should be based on the valuable information presented in earlier iterations of the SFRA and the latest information available on flood zones, areas of flood risk and climate change predictions.  The SFRA Level 1 will:

•	Provide mapping of flood zones, including the functional floodplain; 
•	Enable the application of the Sequential Test and Exception Test; and 
•	Inform the development of local plan policies. 
 
The Assignment

This brief has been prepared by Fenland District Council in consultation with the Environment Agency, Anglian Water and relevant Internal Drainage Board(s). 

The consultant's work will be managed by Fenland District Council and guided by a Steering Group.

LBSUT001-DN412726-64344734,Contract,"London Borough of Sutton",Awarded,2019-07-09T09:59:32Z,"The Construction of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in Schools (London Borough of Sutton)","The London Borough of Sutton, together with the South East Rivers Trust, is undertaking a 'Sutton SuDS in Schools' project. The Carshalton / Hackbridge area of the borough is in a Critical Drainage Area and to alleviate surface water flooding, the project will install SuDS features into seven local schools, to attenuate surface runoff.

The project aims are:

1. Reduce flood risk to 27 properties in the downstream catchment.
2. Eliminate or reduce on-site flooding in playgrounds in some of the schools in the project, as this flooding impacts learning and the school day.
3. The SuDS features installed in the schools will bring educational or recreational benefits meaning school children will gain an understanding of what SuDS are and their importance.

The SuDs in Schools project is in four phases:
 Phase 1 - initial scoping
Phase 2 - design
Phase 3 - construction of SuDS in three schools during the school
summer holidays July - August 2019
Phase 4 - design and construction of SuDS in four educational establishments during the school summer holidays July-August 2020

This commission is only for Phase 3 of the project. Phase 4 will be commissioned separately.

The SuDS tender was originally published in February 2019 however, London Borough of Sutton were unable to proceed as the bids were significantly over budget. The project team have since re-evaluated the works required and updated the specification accordingly. This re-published tender no longer requires the design input that was sought from contractors in the previous tender.

This project is grant funded by the Environment Agency and the budget for the works at each school is as follows:

Harris Junior Academy £90k
Muschamp Primary School £90k
Victor Seymor Primary School £108k

All bids submitted should therefore be in the region of the £288k budget.",,,London,"45112711 45112712 45214210 45111240 45112700 45232450 45232451 45232452 45112710 ","Sharon King-Holmes",sharon.king-holmes@sutton.gov.uk,"Civic Offices","St Nicholas Way",Sutton,"SM1 1EA","United Kingdom","+44 2087705316",http://www.sutton.gov.uk/,,,,25/06/2019,30/08/2019,18/06/2019,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,0,,05/07/2019,421770,"[Initial Systems Limited|TN27 9PB|NONE||Yes|Yes]","Mr Liam Chivers",08/07/2019,30/08/2019,"Open ",

The Local Plan will set out both strategic objectives for the development of the city over the next 15-20 years and will include detailed guidance to manage the type, location and scale of this development, including allocation of specific sites. The National Planning Policy Framework requires that in preparing a Local Plan up-to-date and relevant evidence about the economic, social and environmental characteristics and prospects of the area is utilised. The City Council prepared a Draft Local Plan in September 2016 for a second round of consultation with stakeholders under Regulation 18 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations2012. Responses are currently being analysed. The Council require a Level 1 SFRA to identify the potential flood risks across the City, followed by a more detailed assessment of the flooding implications of developing sites allocated in the Local Plan (Level 2). The Level 2 SFRA should augment the information in Level 1 to enable an Exception Test and a Sequential Approach to be applied and an assessment of existing flood defences. This Assessment should form part of the evidence to inform planning decisions. The Level 2 Assessment should specify the supporting information that planning applicants need to provide to demonstrate that their development meets the requirements of the Exception Test. The 2008 Liverpool City Council Level 1 SFRA reviewed data from the Liverpool Bay Shoreline Management Plan (SMP 1999): Sub Cell 11a - Great Orme's Head to Formby Point and the Mersey Estuary Draft Catchment Flood Management Plan (March 2007). In 2011, LCC completed a Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) to comply with the Flood Risk Regulations (FRR) 2009, as a Lead Local Flood Authority. The PFRA was the first element of a programme to produce Flood Risk Management Plans by 2015. In 2012, an update to the 2008 SFRA commenced but remains unfinished. The current review and update of Liverpool City Council's Level 1 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) 2008 and the unpublished 2012 SFRA, should take into account new information that is now available regarding flooding/flood risk and planning policy. The review should focus on the data that is available from Culverted Watercourse Survey studies that have recently been undertaken or are ongoing, together with new coastal and fluvial flood map data now available from the Environment Agency (EA). These have been extensively updated and the findings need to be incorporated into these SFRA's.

•	Project Aim
•	The aim of this work is to ensure new or revised sublittoral rock, littoral sediment and littoral rock biotopes have been correctly identified from data and represent real communities that occur in the field. Biotopes should meet set criteria outlined in the 'Distinguishing and defining types' section of Connor et. al (2004) . 
•	Background
JNCC is undertaking a project, in collaboration the CNCB s, the Environment Agency, Agri Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBINI) and Cefas to improve coverage of the Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland  (JNCC, 2015). We have analysed new and old survey data together to identify new biotopes and existing ones in need of revision. JNCC are revising existing sections of the classification in turn. Having recently completed a draft update to the Sublittoral Sediment section we are now ready to move on to Sublittoral Rock, Littoral Sediment and Littoral Rock. To date for these sections, we have collated data for analysis, and identified communities using cluster analysis and ordination using R. 
JNCC now wish to contract one or more benthic experts to review the results of community analysis, match the community clusters with biotopes in the classification and identify and describe the clusters that represent new biotopes. Depending on contractors' expertise, JNCC may select a single contractor to work on Sublittoral Rock, Littoral Sediment and Littoral Rock, or different contractors for each of these three broad habitats.

•	Project Aim
•	The aim of this work is to ensure new or revised sublittoral rock, littoral sediment and littoral rock biotopes have been correctly identified from data and represent real communities that occur in the field. Biotopes should meet set criteria outlined in the 'Distinguishing and defining types' section of Connor et. al (2004) . 
•	Background
JNCC is undertaking a project, in collaboration the CNCB s, the Environment Agency, Agri Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBINI) and Cefas to improve coverage of the Marine Habitat Classification for Britain and Ireland  (JNCC, 2015). We have analysed new and old survey data together to identify new biotopes and existing ones in need of revision. JNCC are revising existing sections of the classification in turn. Having recently completed a draft update to the Sublittoral Sediment section we are now ready to move on to Sublittoral Rock, Littoral Sediment and Littoral Rock. To date for these sections, we have collated data for analysis, and identified communities using cluster analysis and ordination using R. 
JNCC now wish to contract one or more benthic experts to review the results of community analysis, match the community clusters with biotopes in the classification and identify and describe the clusters that represent new biotopes. Depending on contractors' expertise, JNCC may select a single contractor to work on Sublittoral Rock, Littoral Sediment and Littoral Rock, or different contractors for each of these three broad habitats. 
In addition, (for Sublittoral Rock, only), over the years since the last classification revision, new biotope proposals have been submitted to JNCC by users who have recorded a community they don't think is represented in the classification. JNCC would like the contractor to compare these biotope proposals with the community clusters from analysis and decide whether they represent true communities that should be included in the classification.",,,"East of England","90700000 ","Megan Parry",megan.parry@jncc.gov.uk,"Monkstone House","City Road",Peterborough,"PE1 1JY",England,"(01733) 866927",www.jncc.defra.gov.uk,"C17-0258-1122 Sublittoral Rock,Littoral Sediment.zip ","http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-7408 ",,08/05/2017,15/09/2017,28/04/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,22000,,08/05/2017,25575,"[Crangon Ltd|15 Cross Bank

This project will assess the migration of adult sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the tidal Yorkshire Ouse. By determining when sea lamprey migrate through the tidal Ouse and which environmental factors may be impacting their migration we can gain a better understanding of these species and the potential pressures that they face. This study should determine how many sea lampreys are migrating through the catchment, how far they migrate and temporality of the migration. 

 The aim of this study is to add to the evidence gained in 2015 and increase our understanding of potential impacts of the annual DO sag on sea lamprey migration through the Humber Estuary. We hope to investigate whether sea lamprey migration occurs at the same time as the DO sag and if these two activities occur at the same time, is the DO sag causing a barrier to sea lamprey migration. 

 This study will only monitor the timing and movements of sea lamprey. Another study will be carried our concurrently by the Environment Agency (EA) who will monitor the DO levels. 

 The data collected from this study will be compared to and analysed against the DO data collected by the EA which should give us an indication of the impact of the DO sag on sea lamprey migration.

Merseytravel has an on-going commitment to provide strategic park and ride facilities across Merseyside. The scheme at Birkenhead North is seen as being part of the fulfilment of the commitment. 
The scheme has hitherto been developed independently to detailed design stage including the obtaining of Planning Permission (with conditions). The outline proposals for the scheme is as follows:
Birkenhead North
Proposal is to construct an extended 671 space car park (267 existing + 404 new) on land formerly occupied by housing to the North of the railway. The existing facility occupies the southern part of the site (immediately north of Station) and was constructed in 2012 when the site was cleared, levelled, and fully enclosed by secure fence.  As part of the 2012 scheme, the Phase 2 site was cleared, utility service mains disconnected (former residential road closed) and top soiled / seeded. The existing operational parking is accessed via a road which crosses the Phase 2 site off Beaufort Road. The works will require excavation to formation, construction of hard standing surface, the necessary marking out, provision of drainage, CCTV and lighting (linked to station), provision of signage within and around the facility. Existing trees planted on North and West boundaries to be retained within the scheme. Limited works will be carried out on the existing operational site to relocate disabled parking spaces and provide new pedestrian walkways. All works to be carried out whilst maintaining normal access to and operation of the existing Park & Ride facility.
Merseytravel would expect the successful Contactor to implement the schemes in line with the requirements of the Planning Conditions, recommendations made by the Environment Agency and in accordance with the recommendations of CEEQUAL including the production of an evidence file.
It would be the responsibility of the successful Contractor to provide the necessary documentation in relation to, but not limited to, Construction Phase Health and Safety Plans, Site Waste Management Plans, Environmental Plans and the O&M Manuals upon completion.
Merseytravel has employed Waterman Consultants to review the existing design information, obtain any outstanding consents and approvals and undertake Contractor Management during the delivery including Site Supervision, CDM-C and Quantity Surveyor services.
Although the scheme is to provide a park and ride site at a railway station, the plot of land on which it is to be created does not lie in rail ownership (though there are interfaces with rail owned land). The land is owned by Wirral MBC and is leased to Merseytravel who in turn lease the land to Merseyrail Electrics (the SFO of Birkenhead North station).
