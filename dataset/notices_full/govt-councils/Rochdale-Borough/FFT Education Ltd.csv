1382/2,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION",Awarded,2018-05-01T19:08:35Z,"RAISEonline Accreditation","*** New on 12th June 2017 - The successful accreditation applicants for the RAISEonline Replacement service - now known as Analyse School Performance (ASP) service are listed in the award section. The award is made following a robust, fair and transparent application and evaluation process. 

The accredited suppliers will receive performance data from the ASP service from 31 May 2017. The intention is that they will develop products that sit alongside ASP but provide value-add, innovative services targeted at schools and colleges to promote self-improvement and performance accountability. 

Take up of these services by schools is entirely optional, and other packages that support them understand performance are available. It is for schools to choose how best to undertake their work about self-improvement and accountability, using whatever software or approach best meets their needs. 

It is currently DfE's intention that applications for accreditation will be reviewed/re-opened on an annual basis.***


This Notice is to alert suppliers that the application process for accreditation for privileged early access to performance data from the RAISEonline replacement services is now open until 12pm on 25 January 2017. All the required application documentation is attached, please follow the instructions carefully.

Once awarded, it is the Department's intention that accreditation will continue on a rolling basis, subject to ongoing monitoring and assessment and the exercise of either party's rights to termination as set out in the Accreditation Agreement.
