      From this tender process, we intend to create a framework of suppliers to deliver the required outputs of the contract. We anticipate appointing eight individual suppliers onto the framework, whose services will be called upon where required. 
      
      Being successfully appointed onto the framework does not guarantee a pre-determined volume of engagements throughout the contract duration. All sessions will be centred on the topic of Business Innovation; however, the content and delivery of sessions will be developed and tailored to meet the requirements of a particular cohort. Once the cohorts has been placed onto the programme, suppliers will be reviewed, and based on their specialisms, the most suitably matched supplier will be appointed to deliver the session.
      
      Should you be successful and be awarded a place on the framework, you may be asked to provide sessions at various locations throughout Cheshire and Warrington, and the Crewe Campus of Manchester Metropolitan University (Cheshire).
      
      Smart Cheshire 
      
      The Smart Cheshire Programme will specifically target SME businesses in Cheshire and Warrington, with the overarching aim of supporting c150 companies exhibiting potential to innovate. These companies will comprise existing small businesses with a minimum of four employees who have traded for a minimum of 12 months. Businesses / individuals will undergo a 4-month structured programme of expert advice, workshops, peer-to-peer support and individual coaching sessions. Success will be measured through a range of indicators including job creation, and development of novel products and processes both within the company and onto the market.
      
      Key Programme Elements:
      
      o The Innovation Programme is focused on those companies with potential / desire to innovate 
      o The programme is focused on development of business innovation, rather than a focus on individual leadership skills. 
      o This is a cohort-based programme, utilising the group's experiences and business acumen to create trusted peer-to-peer networks

"AFA LDL 001",Contract,"G M C V O",Awarded,2015-06-22T14:10:09Z,"Ambition for Ageing - Local Delivery Leads","Ambition for Ageing is a unique cross sector partnership of influential organisations, led by Greater Manchester Centre for Voluntary Organisation (GMCVO), with the aim of developing creative approaches to reducing social isolation for older people in Greater Manchester. The programme is part of the Big Lottery’s national Ageing Better programme which is funding 14 programmes across England. The programme will work in 3 neighbourhoods in eight local authority areas within Greater Manchester.

As part of this programme, GMCVO will be commissioning Local Delivery Leads for each of the local authority areas. They will be responsible for the local management of the programme, engaging with communities and supporting older people to make positive changes to their local areas utilising a community development approach.

These organisations will support older people in the targeted neighbourhoods to volunteer as local ‘investigators’, uncovering and highlighting local assets. Local Delivery Leads will hold devolved budgets and older people themselves will decide where investments should be made.

The procurement has been split into 8 lots, one for each of the local authority areas. Potential applicants have the opportunity to bid for all or any combination of the 8 Lots, however successful applicants will only be awarded a maximum of 2 Lots as lead provider, but may feature as a sub-contractor in more than two successful bids. GMCVO does reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to award more than two lots to an Applicant, where, for example, there are no other viable bids in any particular lot other than that of an Applicant who has the highest ranking in two other lots. The reason for the 2 lot limit is to maximise the test & learn potential by commissioning a variety of approaches and minimising the risks associated with provider failure. The 8 Lots are;

Lot 1 – Bolton
Lot 2 – Bury
Lot 3 – Manchester
Lot 4 – Oldham
Lot 5 – Rochdale
Lot 6 – Salford
Lot 7 – Tameside
Lot 8 – Wigan

Full details and bid documentation can be found at http://www.gmcvo.org.uk/tender/ambition-ageing (an account is required to access this page, potential applicants can register an account at http://www.gmcvo.org.uk/user/register)

Please note the contract value is inclusive of VAT due to the nature of the funding arrangements. Further information regarding the VAT position of this procurement can be found in the PQQ documentation which is available on the GMCVO procurement portal. The initial contract period will be October 2015 – June 2017, with a potential extension for a further 2 years 9 months following a full programme review to take place by April 2017.

Please note dates provided may be subject to change.

The East Midlands Regional Partnership is now seeking to contract with a Higher Education Provider to deliver and quality assure a Cohort 6 Step up to Social Work Programme in the East Midlands Region.

Students are assigned to each local authority in the regional partnership with the intention that, on qualifying, they will be appointed to work in that Local Authority. The Local Authorities commit to providing placements for the students they are supporting. Local Authorities have a vested interest in ensuring that students are trained in a way that meets the needs of the children's services.    

The Step up to Social Work programme leads to a Post Graduate Diploma at MA level and the duration of the programme is to be approximately 14 months commencing in January 2020 and ending in March 2021. The programme must be validated by the HCPC by March 2019 and be prepared to meet the requirements of Social Work England when these come into force.  The programme must enable and support students to meet the refreshed Professional Capabilities Framework (PCF) (August 2018) and the Post-qualifying standard: knowledge and skills statement for child and family practitioners, May 2018.  Students will register with the HEI.

The East Midlands Regional Partnership plan to recruit between 30 and 40 students to Cohort 6 although this number may vary.

The study identified an exciting opportunity to establish a heat transmission network, trading heat between a number of heat suppliers and off-takers. This wider scheme was based upon initial delivery of several decentralised energy network 'clusters' which could then be connected to form a Corridor-wide scheme. These clusters included projects developed by: 1. Octagon Project 2. Bruntwood (Circle Square) 3. Manchester Metropolitan University 4.
