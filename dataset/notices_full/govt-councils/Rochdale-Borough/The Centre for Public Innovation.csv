PADRCL,Contract,"The Mayor's Office of Police and Crime",Awarded,2020-09-03T12:45:01Z,"Partnership Approach to Drug-Related Crime in London","The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime is inviting proposals to deliver consultancy support in the development of a partnership approach to tackling drug-related crime in London.

The London Crime Reduction Board (LCRB) has led the coordination of drugs policy in London over several sessions and supported operational partners, such as the Metropolitan Police Service, in its efforts to protect Londoners from harm. We are now looking for support to help develop the next phase of activity to tackle violence and wider harms linked to drugs.

This Invitation to Tender seeks support in two distinct areas. Firstly, by generating an evidence base for understanding the violence, exploitation, and crime patterns linked to drugs, and map the existing activity within City Hall and wider London stakeholders to tackle these issues. There will be a focus on how public spaces are occupied by those involved in the supply of drugs and those associated with drug misuse; and the violence, exploitation, and antisocial behaviour which stems from it, as well as looking at how London partners are responding to this issue. 

This work will use the evidence obtained to develop a theoretical framework for a new strategic approach to tackling the violence, exploitation, and drug-related crime and antisocial behaviour linked to drugs, with the public health ethos at its heart. This will include the development of a London City Hall approach to these issues through future policy and funding interventions.  

Please submit proposals by email to Andrew.Davis@mopac.london.gov.uk by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 4 Marchry 2020. If you have any questions in relation to this process or tender, these should be submitted via the same email address by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 19 February 2020.

A Health Needs Assessment (HNA) involves the collection and subsequent analysis of data on a population's demand and need for health services. This provides guidance for prioritising health needs and services and determining strategic priorities for the medium and long term. 

HNAs play an important part in guiding an organisation in effectively balancing their efforts in achieving the goals and objectives specific to their strategic direction alongside the government policy and direction of the time.

Vinney Green Secure Unit is situated in South Gloucestershire, located to the north east of the city of Bristol in an area called Emerson's Green. The unit was opened in February 1995 and accommodates up to 24 young people of both sexes, aged between 10 and 17. The main centre, which includes the educational facility, has accommodation for 16 young people. A separate living unit has facilities for up to a further 8 young people.

The unit is licensed for operation by OFSTED and it contracts with the Youth Justice Board to provide placements for young people. It is subject to regular inspection by a range of government and local authority approved officials, to ensure the highest standards are maintained at all times. The unit is managed by South Gloucestershire Council.

Health needs assessment within the SCH setting will be undertaken to:

•	Identify the health needs within the individual population of Vinney Green
•	Identify the gaps within the current service provision
•	Prioritise resources and provision to support commissioners and providers
•	Plan, develop and implement efficient and effective services for current and future needs

The HNA/Social care should consider the wide range of needs of the current and future Vinney Green SCH population and take into consideration those needs that are not currently met identifying gaps within the service in addition to specific population criteria.",,,"South West","85000000 ","Hannah Morley",procurement@swcsu.nhs.uk,"South Plaza, Marlborough Street",,Bristol,"BS1 3NX",England,,,,,,03/04/2017,28/07/2017,22/02/2017,YES,SCW/NHSEQ80/00000355/2016,Yes,Yes,No,Services,15000,,16/03/2017,13450,"[The Centre for Public Innovation|32-36 Loman Street

The Mayor's Police and Crime Plan 2017-21 included a commitment to review the effectiveness of Drug Intervention Programmes (DIP) in London, and that of the current arrangements for drug testing in police custody, to ensure the most effective use of current funds invested in reducing the impact of substance misuse on offending in London.

This review was completed in March 2019, and it has been identified by partners that further work is required to develop a pan-London approach to tackling drugs in London. There are further challenges to implementing the review's recommendations, including the complexity of funding arrangements. 

The London Crime Reduction Board has led the coordination of drugs policy in London over several sessions. The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) are now looking for support to deliver the agreed next steps around DIP and drug treatment in London.

This Invitation to Tender seeks support to map the current funding picture and partnership landscape for offender drug treatment and pathways in London, and to develop and financially model a series of minimum service offers for DIP in London.
