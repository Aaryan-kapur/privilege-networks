            MT179670",Contract,"Family Mosaic",Awarded,2016-08-22T16:45:08Z,"Contractors Framework","Family Mosaic has an ongoing programme of new housing developments throughout London and Essex, and has grant funded programmes with both the GLA and HCA to develop Affordable Housing as part of their 2015/18 Affordable Housing Programmes, the scope of this framework will cover geographically the areas of Greater London and Essex.
Family Mosaic as a group is looking to develop approximately 1,000 new homes per year, across all tenures to reflect Government changing priorities, whilst maintaining a programme of affordable rent by generating cross subsidy through developing shared ownership, private sale and market rent new homes. The proportion of each tenure will dependent on each site and location.
In addition to the above Family Mosaic as Lead Registered Provider will on occasions provide development services to other RPs as part of its funding agreements with the GLA and HCA, together with other separate legal entities formed for specific projects or programmes (these companies are either whole owned or partially owned by a member of the Family Mosaic Group).
Family Mosaic's new works construction programme over the four years duration of this framework is estimated to be in the region of 740 million GBP, with 30% of this delivered by S106s, leaving a balance of 518 million GBP pounds of directly instructed construction works. In addition to the Family Mosaic's programme this framework is being procured on behalf of other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who may wish to develop within London (the GLA area) and Essex, and who wish to sign up to Family Mosaic Framework. This will enable framework suppliers to access an additional volume of work and reduce their pre-qualification costs. At present there is no other RPs or LAs signed up, but to allow scope for this possibility the value of this framework construction costs are estimated not to exceed 600 million GBP.
Family Mosaic Housing wishes to establish a Framework Agreement for Contractor Services with contractors who can deliver on this varied programme together with supplying these services to other Registered Providers and Local Authorities who register to use this Framework for the purposes detailed above in the geographical area of Greater London and Essex.
The scope of this framework is principally to cover new mixed tenure residential developments above the EU procurement threshold, with a majority of the contracts in the range of 5 million GBP to 15 million GBP. For contracts below threshold Family Mosaic may opt to procure from SMEs and for exceptionally large contracts, regeneration projects choose to separately advertise these opportunities as part of an OJEU process. To ensure that Contractors who are appointed to the framework have sufficient financial capacity to carry out contracts on this framework a minimum annual turnover requirement has been set of 18 million GBP (see PQQ).",,,"East of England,London","45210000 45111000 45000000 45211200 45211000 45211100 45211300 45211341 45211340 45200000 ","Cora Marler",cora.marler@sweettgroup.com,"Albion House","20 Queen Elizabeth Street",London,"SE1 2RJ","

INTEXTWOR2016,Contract,"WESTWORKS PROCUREMENT LIMITED",Awarded,2016-05-18T10:17:42Z,"Internal & External Works 2016","Initial expressions of interest are invited from potential providers wishing to provide planned, cyclical and ad hoc external works services to occupied & vacant domestic housing & commercial properties throughout the area covered by Westworks, its members and partners. Providers appointed to the framework may be required to act as main contractor within projects and to utilise supply chains already or yet to be established by Westworks. Similarly providers may be required to act as a supply partner to users partnerships. These occurrences will be clearly indicated to potential providers at the time of contract call off by users and will be incorporated as part of the mini competition process.

The geographical area to be covered by this framework covers the South and South west of England. For an approximate distribution of the volume of works required please review the information in the suite of download documents.
We are therefore inviting variant bids based on GEOGRAPHICAL capability so as to encourage small to medium and larger enterprises to participate. Companies should make clear the areas within which they can presently deliver the services required. Limited geographical coverage by a potential provider will not necessarily exclude them from the process as it is Westworks members aim to encourage local employment and businesses as well as engaging with other suitably qualified providers. It is the intention of Westworks to engage with enough suitably qualified providers to achieve these aims. 

The TOTAL estimated value is between £1 million to £850 million over the entire 4 year life of the framework. 

The framework will be of 13 work stream lots and multiple providers will be considered to achieve geographical and volume coverage for each lot:

1. Kitchen Instalations
2. Bathroom Instalations
3. Electrical Instalations
4. Electrical Testing and Remedial Works
5. Gas Heating Instalations
6. Window Instalations
7. Door Instatlations
8. Groundworks
9. Damp Proofing
10. General Building
11. Flat Roofing
12. Piched Roofing
13. Cavity Wall Insulation Cleaning and Reinstatement

IMPORTANT note:

It is not the intention to split the works by geographical lots but to award places on the framework based on having enough providers to deliver in all areas and to award works contracts by running mini-competitions (mini-tenders) from the framework.

The Framework is split in to 4 main Lots to cover these work streams. To allow for SME bidding opportunities, Lots 1 to 3 are broken down in to 2 sub-lots / value bands. The Lotting Structure is identified as follows:
LOT 1 - Kitchen Installations (1a - Contracts Up to GBP450k, and 1b - Contracts Over 450k).
LOT 2 - Bathroom Installations (2a - Contracts Up to GBP300k, and 2b - Contracts Over 300k).
LOT 3 - Windows and Doors Installations (3a - Contracts Up To GBP200k, and 3b - Contracts Over 200k).
LOT 4 - Communal Door Installations (no value bands).
The main coverage of work required under this Framework will be for installation as supply of materials is covered under a separate Fusion21 procurement exercise for Kitchens, Bathrooms and Windows and Doors. There will be scope however, dependent on individual client requirements, for a supply and install option to be included under this Framework which will be undertaken in the form of a mini competition between Framework partners.",,,"Scotland,North East,Yorkshire and the Humber,North West,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,South East,South West,Wales,Northern Ireland,Any region,London","45300000 39141400 45421151 45211310 45421130 45421100 44221000 39144000 ","Nick Verburg",info@fusion21.co.uk,"Link Road Depot","Link Road Huyton",Liverpool,"L36 6AP","
