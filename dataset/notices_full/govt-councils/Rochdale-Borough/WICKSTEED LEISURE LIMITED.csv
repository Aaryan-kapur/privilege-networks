The current play park is located alongside the B1207 and is adjacent to a skate park, community centre and recreation ground. There is a car park on site.

The area is currently grass with rubber safety mats around the play equipment and is fenced off with 6ft high metal railings.

Users

Brief

• We are wanting to redesign the park to create an attractive themed park and picnic area which provides colour and opportunity for experiential learning. A mix of natural and safety surfacing with a small amount of low level planting. To be fully accessible for children up to 12 years old and for older children with disabilities.

Examples being:

•	Landscape led spaces which utilise more of the available area.
•	Social games (hide and seek).
•	Imagining (gravel, climbing hills). 
•	Quiet individual play.
•	Low level trampolines.
•	Spider frame.
•	Swings for all ages including a basket swing.
•	Picnic area for 3 -4 separate groups.

Elements which are to be retained are the grass mound and large slide plus any other equipment that you feel could be utilised in keeping with the overall theme.

• Scope of works/specification

Full design and build.
Demolition, removal and disposal of existing redundant equipment and surfacing making good any damage.
Installation of new equipment and surfacing.
Existing fence to be made good.

Health and safety
