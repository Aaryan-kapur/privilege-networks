The Commissioners will fund the provider of the service on a block contract basis to offer sexual and reproductive health services for Stockport, Tameside and Trafford residents. The provider must also ensure that comprehensive, open access, sexual and reproductive health services are available to all persons present in their area. 
The service will deliver integrated (not simply co-located) provision provided under one management structure. The provider will work in partnership with other locally commissioned services, both clinical and non-clinical, to maintain and develop homogeneous pathways of care. 
The provider will provide dual trained nursing staff that can provide both contraceptive and STI care to ensure better patient care. ""Dual trained"" means that clinical nursing staff will have training in both provision of contraception and management of sexually transmitted infections. The provider will also provide medical consultant staff who are dual trained and/sufficient sessions of medical consultant time to enable both STI and contraceptive service provision to be consultant led. 

The Commissioners require the integrated sexual and reproductive health service to operate main hub clinics in each of the three areas. The integrated service will be delivered on a hub and spoke basis with a central point of contact and triage (hub) in the three areas.

The Stockport Mental Health Carer Support Service will contribute to Stockport Council's Preventative Commissioning Strategy as well as providing a key element of the front-line mental health service provision alongside staff from Pennine Care NHS Trust.  
  
Services to carers in Stockport are changing in line with the Care Act requirements and the new, integrated and collaborative approach to Health & Social Care across four localities in Stockport, known as Stockport Together. 
Together these key drivers have led to a system change including recommissioning of all services to carers. 
  
  
Scope 
The Stockport Mental Health Carer Support Service will offer services to carers caring for adults aged 18 and over with mental health illness and distress. 
The cared for person will normally be an adult of 18 years or older; services for carers of children and young people are offered outside of this contract. 
The Stockport Mental Health Carer Support Service will provide interventions including information and advice,  statutory assessments when required, support plans for carers which align with the cared for and undertake reviews of those support plans. Within the plans, the service will provide a core part of the offer of support. 
The Stockport Mental Health Carer Support Service will work in close partnership with other providers to support carers undertaking a carer role with people who may not be eligible for services. It is expected that the Stockport Mental Health Carer Support service provider will contribute to and be aligned with other providers giving information and advice and providing short term interventions to prevent escalation of need and carer breakdown.",,,"North West","85320000 ","Peter Walpole",peter.walpole@star-procurement.gov.uk,"STaR Shared Procurement Service","Trafford Council, Trafford Town Hall",Stretford,"M32 0TH","United Kingdom","+44 7875635549",http://www.stockport.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=2921594e-4890-e511-80fb-000c29c9ba21 ",,01/11/2015,31/03/2018,01/09/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,327000,327000,30/09/2015,252832,"[Stockport and District Mind Visit|65 Union Street, Stockport, Cheshire, SK1 3NP|NONE||Yes|Yes]",,01/11/2015,31/03/2018,"Open ",

STOCK001-DN361496-91535974,Contract,"Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council",Awarded,2018-10-17T17:22:03Z,"Remote Enforcement","Parking on school 'keep clear' markings can seriously jeopardise road safety for children and it is the source of a significant number of complaints and demands for parking enforcement. Traditional enforcement using Civil Enforcement Officers (CEO) on foot can be ineffective and inefficient because schools are often in residential areas and may present a parking problem only for a short period of time twice a day. CEOs visit all schools in Stockport twice per term (six times per year) as a minimum. Stockport has 84 Primary Schools, 13 Secondary Schools and 6 Special Schools. Consequently it is difficult to effectively cover the sites but there have also been occasions when the sudden presence of an officer has led to inappropriate driving manoeuvres from drivers eager to escape the possibility of receiving a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). Additional motorists comply, but only whist it is evident the CEO's are on site. Alternative methods of enforcement have therefore been considered. The Traffic Management Act 2004 specifically allows for camera enforcement where traditional CEO enforcement is difficult, sensitive or simply not practical. It is recognised that camera enforcement of this dangerous but short-term practice of parking whilst dropping off children on school zig-zag markings is the only really efficient and effective means of control. The Deregulation Act also allows for CCTV to be used to enforce bus stop/stand clearways and bus lanes. Stockport has specific locations where such enforcement would be of value to assist with highway safety and the efficient operation of bus services. In particular it is envisaged that the Council could use CCTV enforcement of parking on bus stop clearways at some locations close to shops and educational establishments where such parking can be a problem for bus operations.
