1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	The North East Combined Authority (NECA) brings together the local authorities of Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, Sunderland and South Tyneside.  NECA have been successful in receiving funding from the Office for Low Emission and through the European Regional Development Fund to deliver a project to increase the uptake of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) within the NECA area. 
As part of this project we wish to procure a consultant who will be undertake study into the changes in charging behaviour of Electric Vehicles within the NECA area. This will enable us look at the before and after data to assess the impact of the new rapid charging facilities. This will include analysing both quantitative and qualitative data.  This research will enable us to have the evidence base for developing a business model to cover the whole network and importantly to support the expansion of charging across the NELEP area.      

2 	BACKGROUND

                NECA has been successful in obtaining development funding from the Go Ultra Low City Scheme and through the European Development Fund in order to deliver a new wave of Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure across the region. This includes two Go Ultra Low Filling Stations and smaller rapid hubs to add to the existing public charging infrastructure network.  These will provide an innovative solution for urban/sub-urban densely populated areas where vehicle induced air pollution and noise are a problem and off-street parking is scarce. Rapid chargers are envisaged to be used by drivers making short trips as well as longer journeys. One of the GULFS will  in Sunderland and the other will be located on the Science Central site in Newcastle city centre
67,000 plug in cars and 4,000 plug in vans are currently registered on UK roads and numbers are increasing fast. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders for 2015, showed the market for electric, plug-in hybrid and range-extended electric vehicles in the UK went up by 94% from 14,532 at the end of 2014 to 28,188 by the end of last year. The government is committed to all cars and vans being zero emission by 2050 and the DfT had more requests for plugged-in car grants in Jan-Feb this year than in the past 5 years combined.
The charging network in the North East is one of the densest in the country. It was mainly installed as part of the Plugged in Places programme and network management is done through Charge Your Car.  All NECA local authorities are committed to supporting EV use and to expand the network based on evidence and forecasts.

The 24-acre site will become an exemplar in sustainable urban development, known as Science Central (developed by a civic partnership between Newcastle City Council, Newcastle University and Legal & General), attracting leading edge science and technology organisations to a mixed new community which will encompass a variety of educational, business, residential and leisure uses. 

Enabling, infrastructure and public realm works were completed in 2014 to make the site development ready and the first buildings, The Core, The Key and the Urban Sciences Building are now open. Construction works for the NCC Laboratory Building have begun and the University's Learning and Teaching Centre is due to begin mid-September and is expected to open at the beginning of the academic year in September 2019. 

The next Newcastle University building on the Science Central site will accommodate the National Innovation Centre for Ageing and the National Innovation Centre for Data. The address is 3 Science Square, Science Central, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5TG.

This tender was for the recruitment of a main contractor for the National Innovation Centre for Ageing (NICA) and the National Innovation Centre for Data (NICD) scheme.  Due to the dual funding streams from the Government and their respective cash flow criteria, it has been necessary to split the scheme into two phases, essentially the substructure and steelworks and then the remaining construction works.

The funding for this scheme will be provided by the MRC/BEIS Science Investment Fund and the EPSRC/BEIS Fund, with Newcastle University also supplementing those grants.  The construction works are fully covered by the aforementioned but further funding streams may also be realised as the scheme develops, including those from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). 

The contract has been awarded on a 2-stage basis, with the PCSA fee being the amount stated above.  Cost of the works will be confirmed at the end of the second stage.",,,"North East","45000000 ","Michael McGill",michael.mcgill@ncl.ac.uk,"Newcastle University","Higham House","Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 8AF",England,"+44 1912086680",http://www.ncl.ac.uk,,,,04/12/2017,11/10/2019,02/10/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Works,16435,,07/11/2017,16435,"[Bowmer & Kirkland Ltd|North East Region
