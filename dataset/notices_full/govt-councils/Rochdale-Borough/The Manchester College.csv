"FWK1092 - AWARD",Contract,"Parliament UK",Awarded,2016-05-23T15:18:55Z,"FWK1092 - Learning and Development Framework 2 - AWARD","This notice relates to the competition to create a Learning and Development (L&D) framework. Suppliers will be expected to work with in-house L&D professionals and subject matter experts within the business to create bespoke content and to participate in pilots. All methods of delivery will be considered and the ability to provide a variety of approaches would be preferred. 

The activities covered in the Lots below may be some of the many development activities organised by the Houses of Parliament in order to support and achieve the goals set out in both Corporate Business Plans. The intention is that these activities will be ready for delivery as soon as possible after the framework has been agreed. 

Although activities will take place throughout the calendar year, they must fit with the pressures of parliamentary business.  There is likely to be less demand during periods of parliamentary recess. 

Length and timing of activities can vary but will be affected by the needs of the business. Most should be run in core business hours (0900 â€“1730). Most courses will run with a maximum of 12 delegates.  There will be some instances where we may need to run events outside of these hours due to the shift patterns worked by some of our staff. 
Events will normally take place on the Parliamentary Estate.  Suppliers will be expected to travel within the UK as there will be a requirement to provide training for Membersâ€™ staff in their constituencies. 

The Specification of requirements is available for downloading from https://in-tendhost.co.uk/parliamentuk/. 

Division into lots: Lot 1 Programme and Project Management, Lot 2 Financial Management, Lot 3 IT Skills, Lot 4 Parliamentary Subject Specialists, Lot 5 Parliamentary Security Staff
