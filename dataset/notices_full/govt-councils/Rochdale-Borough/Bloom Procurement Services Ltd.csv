Over the next two to three years, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will be replacing its existing grant systems, with a new service called the UKRI Funding Service (TFS). It will be based on a new, digital platform that will make it simpler and quicker for researchers, research offices and innovators to submit funding applications.

All UKRI funding opportunities, of every type and from any organisation (academic or business), will be processed through the TFS service. 

Due to different reasons, TFS has been developed at a slower pace than anticipated. In order to provide an independent perspective, UKRI are wanting to contract an external supplier to provide expertise who are not related to the current supplier to review the following:
•	perform an in-depth analysis of the system architecture and coding standards
•	will propose alternative improved development approaches where needed
•	will create proof of concepts to demonstrate preferred patterns and alternatives 
•	help with the actual implementation involving the existing team as required

Wisbech2020,Contract,"Fenland District Council",Awarded,2018-09-12T12:11:00Z,"Flood Risk Modelling, Study,  Consultancy and Solution","Wisbech Garden Town - Flood mitigation study and modelling

A specialist company is required to provide a comprehensive flood risk study that includes an innovative, fully evidenced based solution in support of the Wisbech 2020 Garden Town Initiative.

The Garden Town would involve construction of 10000 -12000 new homes but will require an innovative flood risk approach to ensure that the housing proposed for the area at risk from flooding is safe and sustainable, and meets the requirements of the NPPF from the flood risk perspective and can satisfy the requirements of the Environment Agency. Part of the Garden Town proposal is in a Flood Zone 3a at risk of flooding from the tidal River Nene.

Therefore only companies who can provide all the services required and can demonstrate the following should reply to this opportunity:  

(1) Utilisation of the Toolset for Rapid Integrated Collaborative Optioneering (TRICO) flood modelling or equivalent that can take into account tidal and fluvial flood situations linked to the 'Fens' unique pumped drainage systems and climate change.

(2)  Next generation computer flood modelling such as (3Di) and interactive mapping to calculate flows and levels to translate hydraulic results to metrics to inform development decision making. 

(3)  Previous UK experience for similar innovative solutions for large scale developments in partnership with key stakeholders such as the Environment Agency, Local Water Authority, Local Council, Developers and DCLG.

(4)  Ability and experience to produce detailed concepts for flood resilient and resistant housing linked to breach-resilient flood defences and other relevant flood mitigation measures.

(5) Able to develop innovative concepts that ensure a robust approach to satisfy and pass NPPF tests and Environment Agency requirements.

(6) Manage all aspects of the process, additional funding opportunities, partnership engagement, workshops, all reports/studies to feed into final report to DCLG that ensures flood risk can be mitigated in the Wisbech situation.

(7) Ability to start within timeframe.  Anticipated to be the end of September 2017.

Please express your interest by evidencing your experience to the above to procurement@fenland.gov.uk by noon Friday 1st September 2017.",,,"East of England","45246400 ","Shaun Beales",procurement@fenland.gov.uk,"Fenland Hall","County Road",March,"PE15 8NQ",England,,www.fenland.gov.uk,,,,30/09/2017,30/06/2019,01/09/2017,YES,Wisbech2020,Yes,No,No,NotApplicable,0,150000,16/10/2017,164535,"[BLOOM PROCUREMENT SERVICES LTD|Rotterdam House 116 Quayside
