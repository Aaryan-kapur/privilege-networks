We are now looking to enter into a new Break/fix IT hardware contract for two years with the option to extend for an additional one year. This will cover numerous IT infrastructure items (See attached Equipment list - Appendix One) predominantly
storage and associated infrastructure items supplied by various OEM's. The intention is that this contract will provide a single point of contact for reporting faults sourcing firmware, replacement hardware, and support. This provides UK SBS with
a degree of extended viability for these items as well as reducing costs.

The objective of this contract is to assist with extending the useful life of the IT infrastructure even when OEM's no longer are prepared to provide direct support for their legacy systems. In the long term, this will help with strategic project planning where costs can be mitigated by extending the life of assets which, whilst
from an OEM perspective have been superseded, are still viable assets in the context of the business requirement.

Scope
The successful bidder will be responsible for :

â¢ Break-fix - Please see the attached equipment list (Appendix One) for the current
devices, however storage devices and associated infrastructure should be the focus of support. In some instances 'Break-fix' will require an engineer to attend and partake in a collaborative install and configuration process with in house IT support before the fix is considered complete. The client anticipates that this will be
established during contact with the supplier's service desk facility.

â¢ Fixed Price Repair (FPR) - There may be instances where UK SBS will require a non-listed item to be repaired i.e. on occasions where an item has come to the end of its natural OEM support or has been downgraded in terms of business criticality
and no longer subject to OEM warranty or support. In this case time and materials at a fixed price repair in accordance with the rate card provided by the bidder in response to question AW5.2 plus the cost of the parts would be acceptable. All costs shall be agreed in writing.

â¢ In some cases UKSBS may wish to add additional items to the list of supported items under the Break fix agreement. 
The current support agreement is for equipment located at several locations including 1 in Europe (Brussels) as per Appendix One. UK SBS would anticipate the support agreement to be in place to ensure the support of this equipment continues and is
available as required inclusive of national Bank Holidays.

Details of the locations of equipment will be provided with the equipment list in Appendix One.
