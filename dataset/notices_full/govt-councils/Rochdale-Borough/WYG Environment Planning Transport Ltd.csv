The Rother District Council – Joint Waste Partnership (JWP) are seeking Contractors to provide a Street Cleansing Monitoring Service.  The Joint Waste Partnership comprises the Waste Collection Authorities of Eastbourne Borough Council, Hastings Borough Council, Rother District Council and Wealden District Council as well as the Disposal Authority East Sussex County Council.

During 2011 and 2012 JWP procured a contract for the provision of waste collection and street cleansing services.  The contract was awarded to Kier Environmental Services Ltd who now collects refuse and recycling from all domestic households as well as being responsible for street and beach cleansing across the JWP area.

The National Indicator (NI) 195 methodology was used as a way for local authorities to measure the local environmental quality of their streets in a structured way.  It also provided local authorities with important performance management information which allowed them to drive up service delivery by focusing resources on poorly performing areas of their service.  It is for these reasons the joint waste and recycling street and beach cleansing contract adopted the NI 195 survey methodology as a way of measuring contractor performance.

The objective of the work is to provide JWP with an accurate, independent view of the standards of street cleansing by adopting NI 195 survey in each of the four partner council areas.  It is anticipated that the successful contractor would be required to start surveying in August 2016.

Please see the full tender for more information.
