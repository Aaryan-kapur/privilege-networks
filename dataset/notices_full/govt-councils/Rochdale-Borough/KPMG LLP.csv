At Ofwat we are gearing up for delivery of the strategy. We are setting up a new team - ""cluster"" - called Insights and Impact that will be at the heart of bringing these ambitions to life.  
The purpose of the Insights and Impact cluster is to support Ofwat in achieving its Vision and Strategy for the sector through high quality insights. It has three goals:
To provide Ofwat with insight needed to understand how the sector is performing and the impact we have had or are having on it to benefit customers, society and the environment. 
To evaluate our policies to understand their effectiveness, including stress-testing ideas before they are implemented.
To develop our data capabilities to underpin all areas of our work, including obtaining better insights and producing high quality evaluation within our cluster but also supporting policy development and enforcement across our other work.
This brief seeks a partner to develop our data strategy, start to define what we are aiming for at a strategic and roadmap level in order to become a data driven organisation and to fulfil our strategy ambitions. The partner will also help us to define some quick wins and an approach to governing this work and measuring its success so it is sustainable as we move into the full implementation phase. The partner will need to work alongside the new Insights and Impact cluster and the Corporate Enabler cluster including senior leaders during February and March 2020.
We need a partner who has devised data strategies before ideally with organisations like Ofwat. We require a written down data strategy as a deliverable at the end of the project. We see the process of getting to that strategy as the main body of work. We are planning to use the process of developing the strategy as an opportunity to mobilise colleagues from across Ofwat and start a process of cultural change. We need to start to put data and insight at the heart of what we do. We need a partner who is willing and able to use the process of the strategy creation to build our internal capacity and capability and diagnose gaps where we will need further work to build our capability in terms of skills, IT equipment or other.We need a partner who will work alongside us as a core part of the team, convening and providing direction, demonstrating a pragmatic approach whilst delivering on quick wins, identifying a clear roadmap for the future and embedding new ways of working. The partner will work alongside us providing advice, coaching our colleagues and sharing their knowledge of having developed data strategy and a roadmap for its delivery in other similarly complex organisations. We would expect our partner to be on site in our Birmingham office (mostly) and our London office (to a limited extent) from the commencement of this work ideally end of January to the end of March.",,,"West Midlands,London","79411000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gov.uk,Birmingham,,Birmingham,B54UA,England,,,,,"For further information,please contact procurement@ofwat.gov.uk",10/02/2020,30/04/2020,20/01/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,110000,,07/02/2020,110000,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

•	Provide more detail to support the consistent reporting requirements for those common performance commitments that currently have them.
•	Send a strong signal to stakeholders about the sector's collective commitment to common performance commitments that currently have them.

It is anticipated that the output of the review will be used to inform business decisions by companies and regulatory decisions by Ofwat. These decisions will directly affect the levels of service provided to all water and sewerage customers in England and Wales and have the potential to have financial impacts in the hundreds of millions £ sterling. There is the potential for these decisions, and the material on which they are based, to be subject to substantial challenge and scrutiny, for example by the Competition and Markets Authority or the Public Accounts Committee. The output of the review must therefore be robust to such challenge and scrutiny.

This work will be used by both Ofwat and Water UK. The scope of the work is expected to be limited to the approaches to the following common performance commitments:

1.	Leakage
2.	Per capita consumption or per household consumption
3.	Supply interruptions
4.	Internal sewer flooding
5.	External sewer flooding
6.	Sewer collapses
7.	Mains bursts
8.	Unplanned outages

A review of the scope following publication of the Ofwat PR19 methodology on 13 December 2017 will enable us to clarify which of per capita consumption or per household consumption will form part of the project. It may also result in one or more measures in this provisional list being dropped; it is possible, although less likely, that additional measures could be added. In the event that an adjustment of less or more measures is required, a revised quotation will be required and will be the basis on which the presentation will be based.

All costs including expenses are to be shared 50/50 between Ofwat and Water UK.",,,"West Midlands,London","79212000 79400000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"PROC.01.0586 Order KPMG signed by triple parties_Redacted.pdf ",,,20/12/2017,30/03/2018,14/12/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,160120,19/12/2017,160120,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

PROC.01.0584,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2018-05-17T14:56:45Z,"Review of Credit Arrangements in the Business Retail Market","The objective of the work is to lead a review of the current credit arrangements included within the Market Codes, provide recommendations on areas that should be reviewed and options that Ofwat should consider to remedy any issues identified. In particular, we are keen to understand whether the current arrangements provide any barriers to entry and/or foreclose the market to new entrants of particular scale. Associated with the credit arrangements, the WRC provides a process and timelines for default and termination for failure to provide eligible credit support. We are keen to understand whether the current provisions of the Code align with the intended timescales. 

MOSL (the Market Operator) carried out an engagement exercise with the industry where it sought views on the wider credit issues faced by market participants. From stakeholder responses, the potential wider policy issues appeared to be:

•	Barriers to entry and expansion for retailers from currently available credit support options.
•	Payment windows and notification processes (includes cashflow issues e.g. cliff edge, incentives for paying on time, Thames).
•	Schedule 3 - is it working effectively and if not what are the issues surrounding its use.
•	Financial assessment and market entry.

Taking the above into account, the scope of the work is therefore to provide Ofwat with a suite of options it may want to take into account in reviewing the current credit arrangements. In particular, this should focus on:

a)	Whether the current credit arrangements are fit for purpose, taking into account Ofwat's policy objectives for the business retail market, its strategy and its statutory duties. 
b)	Whether there are any barriers to entry to new entrant retailers (in particular independent retailers) that arise from the construct of the current Codes or the current collateral requirements and whether these barriers to entry are undue. This includes an assessment as to whether the risk sharing allocation should be amended to favour new entrant retailers with accompanying analysis and evidence.
c)	Any alternative credit options that are not currently provided for in the current suite of credit options available to retailers, drawing on precedent in other sectors and experience of relevant financial instruments. 
d)	An assessment of whether modifications to the current credit arrangements need to be made for self-supply retailers. 
e)	Areas of the Code that require modification or clarification, with accompanying evidence and analysis to support any such modification along with a recommendation for the change itself.
f)	Examining whether the current timelines and processes for termination and default included within the Codes are clear and aligned with the exposure of the wholesaler.
g)	Workshopping with trading parties/market participants and other relevant stakeholders to gauge views on issues relating to the above.
h)	Any suggestions the Contractor may have in addition to the above list.",,,"West Midlands,London","79400000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"PROC.01.0584 SER0734 Order Signed by both parties_Redacted.pdf ",,,15/01/2018,30/03/2018,08/01/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,58996.25,12/01/2018,58996.25,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

PROC.01.0580,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2018-04-11T11:44:29Z,"PR19 - Innovation and Efficiency Gains from the Totex Framework","Objectives and Scope
Since PR14 water companies and their suppliers have had time to gain experience and adapt to the totex and outcomes framework. Different companies have adapted to the new framework at different pace. For PR19, we consider that all water companies should be able to take full advantage of the new framework and deliver significant efficiency savings. 

The overall objectives of this work are to identify the potential scope and range for efficiency savings from the full utilisation of the totex and ODI approach. The principle objective of this work is to deliver a measure of efficiency challenge that Ofwat can apply to baseline costs at PR19. This is to be robust and supported by a broad range of evidence which the Contractor may collect from a variety of sources, amongst which may be: 

•	Examining totex performance in the water sector, and particular examples of best practice of innovations and efficiency savings through using a totex approach.
•	Examining totex performance in the energy sector, and the potential scale of any outperformance that can be attributed to innovation and improved efficiency.
•	Examining cost performance in other sectors to identify the range of cost reductions that might be available, particularly where there have been significant changes such as cost shocks, competition and the introduction of price controls.
•	Examining the performance of other sectors abroad that either have or have introduced regimes similar to totex/ODIs.
•	Developing a conceptual bottom-up assessment, based on sound engineering principles, of the potential that totex/ODIs provide companies.  

We are seeking support to identify the potential scope and range for efficiency savings from the full utilisation of the totex approach in the water sector. 

The expenditure allowances we set to water companies are largely determined through cost benchmarking models which rely significantly on historical cost information. However, historical information will not reflect the full benefits of the totex approach. In setting efficient cost baselines for PR19, we are seeking to understand, what potential efficiency gains from the totex approach we might apply to our cost baselines for PR19. 

We think this work could be divided into two main tasks:

Task 1: Evidence of savings from a totex approach
Task 2: Potential application of totex savings to Ofwat's baselines for PR19",,,"West Midlands,London","79400000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"PROC.01.0580 - totex-signed contract_Redacted.pdf ",,,16/11/2017,30/03/2018,30/10/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,105500,09/11/2017,105500,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

PROC.01.0570,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2017-10-19T17:24:25Z,"PR19 - Direct Procurement for Customers (Technical)","Following the consultation we will publish our final methodology for Price Review (PR19) in December 2017. Ahead of our final methodology we are seeking technical consultancy support to inform us of the types of projects most suitable for Direct Procurement for Customers (DPC) on technical grounds. We expect that well-informed technical parameters will help ensure economic efficiency to maximise value to consumers.

Companies will be responsible for developing the projects as candidates for DPC before running a procurement process that will nominate a competitively appointed provider (CAP). We expect appointees to develop their projects with significant consideration for customer benefits. As this is a new requirement for appointees, we intend to provide robust guidance in December 2017 on the considerations we and the industry should have in selecting appropriate DPC projects. 

The overall objectives of this work are to:
•	Provide us with a set of guidance on the technical characteristics that make a project most suitable for DPC under different scenarios (eg early tender model vs late tender model). 
•	Provide risks (and how these can be managed) and opportunities associated with the technical project characteristics for different project types and tender models.
•	Derive a set of key technical criteria and principles that both Ofwat and the industry can use in developing and assessing candidate DPC projects, as well as how they align with commercial principles laid out in our methodology consultation.

We expect this work will comprise the following main activities:
1)	The contractor will develop guidance for Ofwat on the technical characteristics that make projects most conducive for DPC and deliver the greatest customer benefit. 
2)	To inform Ofwat's view of the relative risks of different DPC candidate projects, the contractor will advise us on the risks (and how these can be managed) and opportunities associated with the technical project characteristics for different project types and tender models from activity 1.
3)	Based on an in-depth understanding of the technical thresholds and applying a hierarchy to potential DPC projects (activity 1), and the risks and issues associated with these for delivery (activity 2), we are seeking advice on establishing a set of technical principles that will support the commercial principles laid out in our PR19 methodology consultation and being developed in a parallel consultancy contract, PR19 - Direct Procurement for Customers - Commercial.",,,London,"73200000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"20171009 PROC 01.0570- Signed by both parties_Redacted.pdf ",,"Please note that PROC.01.0544 has been incorrectly used and this procurement should have used PROC.01.0570 in all documentation.",21/08/2017,12/12/2017,08/08/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,45720,17/08/2017,45720,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

This includes investigating, publishing reports and giving advice to the Secretary of State on whether and at what cost it is meeting the objectives of the current Road Investment Strategy (RIS).
The RIS Investment Plan sets out the details of capital investment that Highways England must deliver over the first road period (April 2015 to March 2020). Highways England has been allowed funding of £3.7 billion to deliver its programme of asset maintenance and renewals (M&R), to ensure the Strategic Road Network (SRN) is maintained in a safe and serviceable condition. 
Highways England sets out its high level plans for the volumes and costs of M&R work in its Delivery Plan, and its subsequent updates. Highways England provides, on a regular basis, progress reports of M&R delivery including a summary of expenditure against budget, renewals volumes and asset inventory and condition information.
The SRN assets fall into five main categories: pavement, structures, geotechnical, drainage and technology. This study focuses on pavement and structures.
A key part of ORR’s monitoring is to understand Highways England’s delivery of the Investment Plan, including whether it is adopting a sustainable approach to maintaining and renewing its assets.
The purpose of this project is to assess Highways England’s development and delivery of sustainable and efficient asset interventions by carrying out in-depth reviews of M&R delivery, on an asset by asset basis.

The site covers an area of over 900 acres spread over a wide area across the wider Redcar steelworks plant.

Government and GovCo wish to transfer the Keep Safe activities from the Liquidator to GovCo as soon as possible.  A critical step towards completing this transfer is the completion of financial due diligence of the Keep Safe activities, resulting in the creation of GovCo’s business plan.
The chosen financial advisor will conduct an appropriate level of financial due diligence of the Keep Safe business.  Whilst this will require some understanding of the pre-liquidation operations, however, we acknowledge that pre-appointment records may not be complete or available.  As a result, the primary focus of the financial due diligence will be on the expenditure and income during the post–liquidation period.
The output and key findings from the due diligence will feed into the business plan, completion of which will be led by the financial advisor, with support from DLA and GovCo management.  
At the end of the assignment, control of the business plan and any supporting financial models will be transferred to GovCo, so that GovCo management can continue to develop the document as time and objectives progress.
Through the engagement period, frequent updates will be provided on the progress of the work, highlighting any material findings coming to light.

•	An opinion on where each Corporate Provider sits on the operating model;
•	Assessment of likely or imminent failure. 
This is a highly specialised area and the skill set and experience required for the task is a key requirement to meet the overall objective of assuring CQC that the financial and business aspects of companies providing care services are viable.

CQC  has a secure portal for information exchange between CQC and the providers and this will be needed to be used as the primary storage of information 

Activity Two:
Confirm that the following have not changed
o	Group structure, including the structure of its registered providers registered with CQC
o	Shareholders
o	Lenders
o	Properties

This task may be completed by analysing publicly available information; information provided by the provider and may need to be supplemented with discussions with the providers in question.

Activity Three

•	Is there too much debt?
•	Can they afford to pay their debts?
•	Is the annual budget deliverable?
•	Where are they on the operating model?",,,"Any region","79000000 ","CQC PSO 064 Financial Assessment Adult Social Care Providers",commercialcontracts@cqc.org.uk,"151 Buckingham Palace Road",,London,"SW1W 9SZ",England,,,"20160205 CQC PSO 064 Market Oversight Interim_Redacted.pdf ",,,01/10/2015,31/03/2016,08/09/2015,NO,,No,No,No,Services,176889,,28/09/2015,176889,"[KPMG LLP|15 Canada Square

https://data.gov.uk/data/contracts-finder-archive/contract/770035/

The Civil Service Commission and Commissioner for Public Appointments have legal duties to monitor compliance with the Civil Service Recruitment Principles (under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010) and the Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies (under the Public Appointments Order in Council 2002).

Sir David Normington is currently dual post-holder as the First Civil Service Commissioner and Commissioner for Public Appointments. He is committed to increasing convergence of the regulatory practice and policy for Civil Service and public appointments and in support of this we are seeking to contract a single external supplier to carry out the compliance monitoring work under a single contract with a greater focus on reviewing departmental capability and compliance as opposed to delivering procedural audits. The contractor will form a key part of an overall regulatory approach designed to assure and improve the quality of merit-based civil service and public appointments through fair and transparent processes.

The key elements of such a solution will be an ability to monitor departmental capability and compliance with the Civil Service Recruitment Principles and the new principle-based Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies on an annual basis in a way that provides public and Parliamentary assurance, addresses issues of non-compliance in a timely and effective manner, delivers improved practice across departments, and builds capability in departments to make merit-based appointments. The successful contractor will also be asked to assess how departments uphold and promote the Civil Service Code which sets out the Civil Service values and behaviours expected from civil servants to uphold them.",,,"Any region","79212000 ","CCS London Managed Service Team",ManagedProcurementService@crowncommercial.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Aviation House","125 Kingsway",London,"WC2B 6NH",England,,www.gov.uk/ccs,"SO15742 Redacted contract extension award letter.pdf ",,,01/04/2013,31/03/2018,14/09/2012,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1000516,,30/11/2012,1000516,"[KPMG LLP|Canary Wharf (12th Floor)

About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.

It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.

UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It’s what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS’ goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.

UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.

Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.

UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14. 
Important information

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

This notice is for the publication of the Consultancy Value Statement which indicates the financial and non-financial value which has been delivered from this Contract. 
The project aims to identify appropriate sites across government rooftop and brownfield site estate – which are otherwise under-utilised or have little alternative use – for solar generation to maximise returns for the government through reduction in energy costs for customers and rental payments. The purpose of the procurement is therefore to obtain financial advice to supplement the legal advice currently being sought for the setting up and operation of a government-owned solar development company (DevCo) and the subsequent sale of a majority stake to a joint venture partner, to be run as a call-off from the Consultancy One framework contract, under Lot 4.1 (Corporate Finance and Financial Strategy). The service will comprise two phases: the first (DevCo set up) will include validation of the financial model included in the Outline Business Case; financial modelling to assess project-specific economics; and benchmarking of commercial development fees and profit margins, payment flows, taxation, balance sheet treatment, State Aid considerations, CfD bidding tactics and funding options across the project lifecycle. Phase 2 will include assistance with the possible sale of DevCo to include soft market testing which will inform the development of a commercial structure and preparation of the financial model to be used; as well as assistance with evaluating bids and assessing options for a full exit, including contributing towards the preparation of the Final Business Case.

The Framework complies with EU rules and is available to BIS and other Departments and agencies.  
It replaces the current Framework Agreement, which has been running since 1 January 2012 and will end on 1 January 2016. This has been widely used and well received by BIS analysts.  With no other Framework in place which suit BIS requirements, a new Framework is being commissioned to ensure that BIS continues to have access to high quality, efficient research and evaluation service providers.
 
The new Framework will run from 2 January 2016 to 2 January 2020.
The Framework establishes the terms and conditions under which the customer can enter into contracts for specified services.  It offers high quality research and evaluation service providers under 8 service areas detailed below. These are core areas of activity for BIS.
These cover a wide range of methodological expertise. We also want to draw on specialist expertise in a wide range of policy areas. We recognise that not all organisations will have that detailed specialist knowledge.

These services require the supplier to draw upon a range of disciplines, experience and knowledge including government finance, budgeting, finance systems, technical accounting skills and project and programme management and delivery. 
MoJ has agreed to source this service by putting in place a framework agreement, which can also be accessed by the Home Office, HM Treasury and all of their associated arm’s length bodies. The framework will be established with up to 6 suppliers. 
Given the complex nature of change initiatives, the suppliers' multi-disciplinary teams are expected to comprise experienced professionals who have completed professional qualifications in their area of expertise. It is expected that the team provided will be solely dedicated to the engagement for its duration in order to support and prioritise effective delivery. The teams will be required to work alongside our internal teams and integrate effectively at our locations. The following core elements of the requirement are to be:

• Resource Delivery Model - Resources will be tasked with developing their own delivery plans as part of the engagement with change teams, ensuring plans meet overall delivery objectives. Resources will be responsible for delivering to agreed milestones and providing the relevant project input to programme and portfolio oversight teams. 
• Technical Accounting Expertise - Resources shall be expected to provide expert technical knowledge, research, expertise and support to change teams, have relevant and up-to-date technical knowledge of the broader financial regulatory frameworks, and be well versed in Government reporting and budgeting regulation. 
• Advocacy - Resources will be expected to embed full-time alongside existing change teams to proactively identify issues, highlighting implications and proposing suitable solutions or alternative methodology to achieve required outcomes. Resources will be expected to engage and influence internal and external stakeholders to drive issues through to conclusion. 
• Finance Improvement Activities - Resources will be expected to identify and implement finance improvement activities, including system and process design, implementation and broader advice on the requirements for ongoing monitoring of activity, including how governance and assurance processes should operate to ensure the requisite level of senior management scrutiny is maintained. 
• Knowledge Transfer - Resources will be required to propose plans for increasing the skills of in-house staff and an agreed process to ensure knowledge transfer at the conclusion of work packages. Resources will also be required to demonstrate how they will make this happen and how they will deliver value for money both through their direct work and through the enhancement of in-house capability.",,,"South East","79200000 79400000 ","Charlotte Dodden",charlotte.dodden@justice.gsi.gov.uk,"Ministry of Justice","102 Petty France",London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,,23/09/2015,23/09/2018,09/06/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,20000000,50000000,23/09/2015,0,"[Allen Lane Consultancy Limited|30 City Road

This will enable the Operational Excellence transformation programme to be delivered at the required pace whilst leaving a sustainable legacy of change and improvement capability in Operations.",,"B1 1RN","West Midlands","73000000 ","Lauren Hopkins",Lauren.hopkins@highwaysengland.co.uk,"8 City Walk",,Leeds,"LS11 9AT",England,,,,,,01/01/2018,31/12/2020,14/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,731025,,22/12/2017,731025,"[McKinsey & Company|No. 1 Jermyn Street, London, SW1Y 4UH|NONE||No|No][Atkins|The Axis, 10 Holliday Street, Birmingham, West Midlands, B1 1TF|NONE||No|No][Ernst & Young|More London Place, London, Greater London, SE1 2AF|NONE||No|No][KPMG LLP|FLOOR 12, 15 CANADA SQUARE, LONDON, Greater London, E14 5GL|NONE||No|No]",,01/01/2018,31/12/2020,"Open ",
