These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

The Contract for the Service with the current provider is due to expire on 31st March 2020.
The Service Provider will work independently of all Services provided to Children and Young People in Wakefield to ensure that the practice is child focussed and not restrained by external pressures. It is acknowledged that the role of an advocate is unique and that advocates must be led by the child or young person's wishes, not their view of the child's best interests, and therefore, assisting a child to express his or her wishes is a contribution to the welfare of the child even though it may appear to conflict with decisions about the child or young person's best interest. There is an expectation that children and young people will receive information and support via or alongside their parents but Local Authorities must ensure that children and young people are able to receive information and support separately from their parents.

The Leaving Care Service fulfils a statutory duty of the Local Authority and must meet the requirements of the Care Leavers (England) Regulations 2010 and the Children Act 1989. Further details of the service are contained within the tender documents, notably 'Document 1 - Information for Bidders and Service Specification'.
Throughout the contract period, suppliers are asked to note that Lincolnshire County Council may provide additional resources (subject to evidence of need and related service impact) for any of the following reasons:
• An increase in care leaver numbers above tolerances set out in the Service Specification
• An increase in complexity of care leaver needs
• Changes in statutory guidance, legislation or case law that will impact on service delivery.
Where Lincolnshire County Council is able to provide in-kind support to enhance the delivery of the service, any resulting in cost savings should be reinvested by the supplier back into service delivery.
The majority of care leavers live within Lincolnshire. Approximately 42% are based out of county; the majority of these are resident in bordering Local Authorities but can be anywhere in the UK.
All clarifications should be submitted through the ProContract procurement portal, as should tender submissions.
The clarification deadline is Monday 14th October at 12.00pm (noon) and the tender will close on Monday 28th October at 12.00pm (noon).

The initial priorities will be to offer good quality cost effective residential care to meet the needs of Looked After Children (LAC) with complex behaviours and disabilities and to provide additional capacity to enhance edge of care services. The CPS covers the whole care system from point of entry in Children's Services to leaving care and aims to manage demand and provide the most cost effective placement and support services that deliver the best outcomes for children and young people. The Council wishes to enter into a collaboration agreement with an organisation or lead organisation acting for a consortium that can both design and deliver innovative services that provide improved outcomes for Leicestershire young people on the edge of care through to leaving care including children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). The CIP will include 3 stages:
- design,
- delivery and
- evaluation.
The Council expects the Partner to be able to bring its own financial or in kind contribution to the design stage and to the delivery stage to enhance the Councils statutory requirements in providing services to LAC and children with Send. The Partner must have both the capacity to provide high quality advice and deliver major change in children's services. It is expected that the Partner will have the experience, expertise and quality standards to deliver the majority of services designed by the CIP and therefore must have a proven track record in providing children's services for edge of care, fostering, adoption, permanence and care leavers.
The estimated annual value is 70 400 000 GBP this is based on the 2018/19 budgets for the services covered by the CIP. The estimated total value is 704 000 000 GBP over 10 years. It is not intended that the full budget for each service area will be spent through the CIP. The Council will continue to use existing contracts and frameworks to purchase services. The scope and cost for each service delivered through the CIP will be agreed between the Council and the Partner as part of the design stage and will be within the budget envelope for existing services.

This is a competitive process in order to establish a Framework of value for money, quality assured Providers. The aim is that there will be a variety of Alternative Provision programmes/activities/services supporting children and young people which can be accessed by Bournemouth Borough Council, Dorset County Council, the Borough of Poole and all Schools (including specialist schools and academies). During the planning of this Framework the project group have developed a competitive process for organisations who provide alternative provision services to children and young people, to be added to a quality assured Framework in order that they can deliver their services throughout the county of Dorset, including Bournemouth and Poole. To comply with procurement regulations tenders will be invited for services within the main service categories, which are: * Engagement & Reengagement * Therapeutic * Counselling * Vocational Provision & Employability * Teaching To ensure that a range of Alternative Provision services are made available across the County that can meet the diverse range of needs and circumstances of children and young people, this tender is to establish a Framework of Alternative Provision providers across a range of services. It is our intention that the Framework will run from September 2018 to September 2022. The Framework is designated as a 'Rolling Flexible Framework' which is using the functionality of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) procedure and has been adapted under the Light Touch Regime. As soon as the competitive process closes then the next round will open. This will allow new providers to join the Framework and allow existing providers to change the services that they offer throughout the Framework period. This will ensure that children and young people continue to benefit from new opportunities, from the entry of new providers and have an evolving and wide range of choices/support to meet their needs. The intention is that the Framework will develop and change as required. Existing Framework members will remain on the Framework until it expires, they leave or are removed under the provisions of their individual Framework agreement and they will not need to re-join each year. The Framework will re-open and submissions will be evaluated on a 4-monthly basis. The indicative spend for Dorset County Council is £499,525 per annum. Historically there has been a Dorset County Council contract in place for mentoring valued from £97,900 - £139,008. This indicative spend for Bournemouth Borough Council is £424,869 per annum and the Borough of Poole indicative spend is £197,282 per annum.

Lancashire County Council believes that as many CYP with SEND as is possible should be able to access and enjoy short break services. The service will be available to service users who live in Lancashire (excluding Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool). The service is commissioned during school holidays.

The service seeks to improve outcomes for both CYP and their parents and carers. The service advocates that parents and carers are supported in their caring role and those CYP with SEND are supported to engage in life enriching activities and to socialise with their peers in a safe and comfortable environment.

The value of the Framework for the initial period of 12 months is approximately £1,020,000. The Framework may be extended for a further 24 months subject to the conditions set out in the contractual documents.

The Providers will achieve the following overall outcomes in relation to children placed with their carers:

• Children's welfare is safeguarded and promoted 
• Individual children's outcomes are improved

Specific outcomes will also be discussed, agreed and recorded within the Service User's Care Plan.

It is intended that call-offs from the framework will be administered by the Council's Access to Resources Team.

*24275,Contract,"NHS Shared Business Services",Awarded,2017-10-16T16:08:38Z,"Children & Young People's Emotional Health & Wellbeing Service","NHS Harrow Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Harrow Council are seeking to commission a targeted Children and Young People's Emotional Health & Wellbeing Service for its registered population. 

In March 2015 the government published 'Future in Mind', their strategy for promoting, protecting and improving children and young people's mental health and wellbeing. With the guidance came funding to invest in children and young people's mental health services. In order to access this funding, local authorities and CCGs were tasked with developing local transformation plans, in collaboration with their key stakeholders, which clearly outline how this money will be invested. Harrow CCG and Harrow Council wrote a joint plan with North West London CCG's with 8 priority areas, all with local objectives, which was approved by NHS England in December 2015. 

Priority 5 of our Future in Mind Transformation Plan: Transforming Pathways - A Tier Free System, Harrow local priority is to develop an Integrated Emotional Health and Wellbeing Targeted Service (e.g. CAMHS Tier 2/2.5). This will be an early intervention/prevention provision, identifying and targeted at children and young people with an identified need. This includes Children in Need, children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities, Children Looked After, children and young people with challenging behaviour, bereavement, life events, school exclusion, OCD, difficulties with eating/sleeping, ADHD and ASD. It will include community outreach and provision in schools. There are an estimated 3695 children and young people (aged 0-18) in Harrow who may be eligible for this provision. 

The service is to be innovative and flexible, offering short to medium term intervention, preventing further escalation of the child/young person's needs and enabling them to be empowered and more resilient. The service will offer a range of therapeutic short to medium term interventions including but not exhaustive of: 

• Direct clinical 1:1 therapy CBT/Psychotherapy/DBT

This funding will be split amongst a number of current and new projects which are central to the Force’s strategic objectives, as part of this funding the Force is looking to start two new projects relating to domestic abuse.
This opportunity specifically relates to one of the new projects which will be the creation of a programme to tackle domestic abuse perpetrators. 
The Force is looking to appoint a single organisation who can deliver programmes of education for perpetrators of Domestic Abuse across the whole Northumbria Policing area. The programmes will focus on heterosexual male perpetrators who are 18 years old and over, however the Force would be interested in exploring whether services could also be offered to other groups of perpetrators. 
The educational programmes are to reflect the standards which are set and defined by RESPECT and the provider would be expected to work towards gaining RESPECT accreditation.  
The organisations must provide perpetrators easy access to services in each of the six local authority areas in the Northumbria Police area as some perpetrators will not have the means to travel any distances. This could be through having an office base in each local authority area or some other easy access arrangement.   The local authorities covered in the Force area are:

Gateshead Local Authority
Newcastle Local Authority
Northumberland Local Authority
North Tyneside Local Authority
South Tyneside Local Authority
Sunderland Local Authority

There are already voluntary domestic abuse perpetrator programmes set up in some of the outlined local authority areas across the force.  The successful provider would be expected to work with these existing providers, not in competition with them.  The overall aim is effective service provision across the force area. It is expected that the successful provider will focus service provision in those areas that either don’t have coverage or in the areas where the demand outweighs capacity in those areas that do have coverage.

Funding available:

£276,341 of the funding applies to the first year of the contract, ending 31st March 2016
£278,795 of the funding applies to the second year of the contract, 1st April 2016 – 31st March 2017.

The funding allocated for each year of the agreement needs to be spent by the end of the financial year for this period. For the avoidance of doubt the end of the financial year will be the 31st March. 
Contractors are asked to note that the second years funding is subject to further approval, if for any reason the second years funding is not made available to the Force, the contract will terminate at the end of the first year.

				Hull City Council is seeking suitably qualified and experienced
				providers to deliver a Young Carers Support Service. The contract
				will commence 1 June 2015 for a period of 24 months ending 31 May
				2017 with an option for extensions for up to a maximum of 12 months.
				Such extension will be at the discretion of the Council and subject
				to satisfactory performance and monitoring. Young carers are
				children and young people under 18 who provide, or intend to provide
				regular or ongoing care, assistance or emotional support for another
				family member, who is disabled, physically or mentally ill, or has
				problematic substance or alcohol use. They carry out, often on a
				regular basis, significant or substantial caring tasks, taking on a
				level of responsibility that is inappropriate to their age or
				development. Hull City Council is determined to ensure that, as part
				of the Early Help and Priority Families Strategy, young carers are
				given the support they need at the time they need it to enable them
				to manage and balance their caring responsibilities with their right
				to have a childhood. As part of the early help coordination, Hull
				City Council is seeking to establish a contract for a Young Carers
				Support Service to support with the identification of children with
				additional family burdens and to actively work with young carers and
				their families. The aim is to reduce the level of inappropriate
				caring, promote the health and development of young carers and
				develop strong support systems for young people likely to be long
				term carers while not undermining the parent. Under this contract
				the Supplier will be required to actively contribute to the
				achievement of social objectives. These include: skills development;
				employment and training opportunities within the locality of where
				the contract will be delivered; and other added value initiatives
				throughout the supply chain to support community programmes promoted
				by the council. Accordingly contract performance conditions may
				relate in particular to secondary considerations. Suppliers
				should note that TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
				Employment) Regulations 2006) may apply.

Lancashire County Council (LCC) believes that as many CYP with SEND as is possible should be able to access and enjoy short break services. The service will be available to service users who live in Lancashire (excluding Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool). The service is commissioned during school holidays.

The service seeks to improve outcomes for both CYP and their parents and carers. The service advocates that parents and carers are supported in their caring role and those CYP with SEND are supported to engage in life enriching activities and to socialise with their peers in a safe and comfortable environment.

The value of the Framework for the initial period of 12 months is approximately £1,000,000. The Framework may be extended for a further 6 months subject to the conditions set out in the ITT and contractual documents.

There is however no obligation to award the contract/s following this tender exercise. The aim of the exercise is to award a range of services within the specified financial envelope. The overall contract value is £110,000. The demand in Barnsley for a short break continues to grow at a time when pressure on existing resource is increasing therefore all commissioned services will need to demonstrate best value both at the point of tender and through the lifetime of the contract. It is expected that contract values will vary between services/providers due to differences in outputs, activity and complexity of need/age. Therefore providers must clearly outline in their tender submission the level and type of service they aim to provide and the cost of this service. This should include:  Information in relation to staffing (ratios/experience) which will link to complexity of need in relation to provision provided.  Outputs (numbers of children and duration/frequency of activities)  What it is that will be delivered, the cost of this provision and how the cost will be profiled. All interested organisations must complete the response document provided and be aware that in addition to this document a presentation will also be required. The presentation will be 10 minutes in length with time at the end for questions. The presentation will be delivered to a panel of children and young people who may potentially access your service. The title of the presentation is 'All About My Service'. The panel will score your presentation and this score will be transferred into the tender evaluation process. Criteria for the presentation will be published via YORtender before the closing date for the tender.
