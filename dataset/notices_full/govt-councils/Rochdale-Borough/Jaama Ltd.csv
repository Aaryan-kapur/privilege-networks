20191029093130-37280,Contract,"The Police and Crime Commissioner for Derbyshire",Awarded,2019-10-29T09:31:35Z,"Provision and On-going Support of a Fleet Management System","Derbyshire Constabulary and Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service have jointly assessed the current capabilities within the respective organisations with regards to the recording of fleet data. It has been identified that there is a need to improve this capability as the existing systems are no longer fit-for-purpose. 
It is expected that this solution will be used in a fully collaborative manner between Derbyshire Constabulary and Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service (i.e. same database, same interface). Due to the security differences between the networks an externally cloud hosted solution, based in the UK, must be proposed by the bidder. It is also anticipated that a COTS (Commercial off the Shelf) system will be suitable as long as there is the capability to reconfigure field labels to meet the requirements laid out in this document.",,"DE5 3RS","Any region","50111100 ","Rob Atkinson",robert.atkinson.16686@derbyshire.pnn.police.uk,"Force Headquarters, Butterley Hall",,"Ripley, Derbyshire","DE5 3RS",ENG,"+44 3001225371",,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=27130&B=BLUELIGHT https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/37280 ",,13/03/2019,14/03/2019,12/03/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,100000,150000,15/05/2019,238596.25,"[Jaama Ltd|6 Lichfield Street
