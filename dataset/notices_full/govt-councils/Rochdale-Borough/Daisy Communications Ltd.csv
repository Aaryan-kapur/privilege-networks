Public Services Network (PSN) for use by or on behalf of the UK public sector bodies listed at VI.3 of the Contract Notice (and any future successors to these organisations).

The listed public sector bodies have a need for the provision of connectivity, telecommunications and other services, including PSN compliant services and non PSN compliant services, to facilitate inter-organisational collaboration through secure communication, interoperability and sharing of information.

This Framework Agreement addresses this need by facilitating the provision of innovative connectivity and telecommunications and other services for the UK public sector as a whole. The services available under the Framework Agreement include data access services; local connectivity services; traditional telephony services; inbound telephony services; IP-telephony solutions; mobile, voice and data services; paging services; video conferencing; audio conferencing; and integrated communications services. Including, but not limited to, networks, Wi-Fi, gateways & related services; voice lines and minute bundles; mobile services including voice and data, pager services; email services; internet service provision, content filtering services and intruder detection systems; communication services including video and audio conferencing services, and unified communications; call centre services; and associated supporting services including but not limited to security, information assurance, design/build/operate consultancy, acquisition, technology audit and site surveys; and other services as described in the Contract Notice (provided as an attachment); the Framework Agreement; the Call Off Terms; and the Call Off Order Form .

The Framework Agreement is suitable for the provision of services that are PSN compliant; and also for the provision of services at lower security levels; or that do not require PSN compliance.

The services are required to be provided primarily to the UK, although the Framework Agreement may also be used by UK contracting authorities to service their overseas sites. The Contracting Authority considers that this Procurement may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). No weight was attached to whether or not an economic operator was an SME when assessing the most economically advantageous tender.

The Framework Agreement will have an initial term of two (2) years with the option to extend by two further terms of up to one (1) year each. 

Electronic auctions may be employed by Contracting Bodies using the Framework Agreement.

Any stated contract values are merely estimates  of likely business.
