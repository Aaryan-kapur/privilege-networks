Across Knowsley, Liverpool and Sefton (Tripartite) Adult Social Care is changing. By 2021 health and social care services across the Tripartite will be delivered around customer need and not organisational form.  
To achieve this, we will be:
•	Developing a Place Based Model of Care - Optimising community resilience, capacity and assets to support people in their own home.
•	Placing individuals and families at the heart of the care system, through self-directed models of care, to provide the most efficient and effective pathways across the system.
•	Focusing more on prevention and early intervention, maximising opportunities for self-care to keep people as independent as possible, for as long as possible.


To support our ambitions, we are looking to:
•	Develop a strength/asset based Resource Allocation System (Lot 1)
•	Develop and implement a culture change programme across the Tripartite Social Care Workforce. (Lot 2)
