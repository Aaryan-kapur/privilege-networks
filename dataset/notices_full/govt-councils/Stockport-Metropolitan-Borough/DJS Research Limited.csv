It replaces the current Framework Agreement, which has been running since 1 January 2012 and will end on 1 January 2016. This has been widely used and well received by BIS analysts.  With no other Framework in place which suit BIS requirements, a new Framework is being commissioned to ensure that BIS continues to have access to high quality, efficient research and evaluation service providers.
 
The new Framework will run from 2 January 2016 to 2 January 2020.
The Framework establishes the terms and conditions under which the customer can enter into contracts for specified services.  It offers high quality research and evaluation service providers under 8 service areas detailed below. These are core areas of activity for BIS.
These cover a wide range of methodological expertise. We also want to draw on specialist expertise in a wide range of policy areas. We recognise that not all organisations will have that detailed specialist knowledge.
