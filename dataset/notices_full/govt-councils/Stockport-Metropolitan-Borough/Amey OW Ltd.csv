In broad terms, the review will encompass:

•	Review of the boundaries of the existing CPZs, including their sub-zones.
•	Investigation and recommendations on whether to extend the existing CPZs into new controlled parking zones to the north, south and east of the existing CPZs to meet current and future demands.
•	Review of the operational times of the existing CPZs.
•	Review and recommend any changes to the charging tariffs for paid for parking, both for on-street and off-street provisions including between zones and sub-zones.
•	Review of existing permit arrangements for residents and businesses. This review will not include provision for charging for residents and visitor permits, which are currently free of charge.
•	Maximising on-street parking provision, and therefore revenue, to meet the increasing parking demand for visitors, businesses and also commuters where appropriate. It is not proposed to introduce significant areas of residents parking areas but where this may be necessary then any new schemes will need to comply with Liverpool's Residents Parking Policy.

This is to replace Centro's existing framework that expires on 30th September 2015.

The framework will consist of 4 Lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Project Development and Delivery

Lot 2 - Transport Planning

Lot 3 - Project Management and Programme Management Office

Lot 4 - Market Research and Data Processing

Centro is proposing to qualify either 1, 3 or 4 consultants to each Lot of the framework and will usually undertake a suitable mini competition process to award each call-off.

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

Tenders are due back by the closing date of 12 noon on Monday 24th August 2015 and the deadline for clarification questions is 12 noon on Monday 17th August 2015.

Centro is holding a pre-tender Briefing Session for all interested bidders for this framework on Tuesday 14th July 2015 at Centro House, 16 Summer Lane, Birmingham, B19 3SD from 1100 - 1300. if this is of interest would you please confirm your attendance by 1200 on Monday 13th July 2015.

This Framework Agreement is available for any Local Authority, Integrated Transport Authority or public body in the U.K. to access and order from including specifically all seven West Midlands authorities (Birmingham City Council, Solihull, Coventry, Dudley, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Sandwell).

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

As this is a Framework Agreement it is not known at this stage what the aggregate value of spend will be across the various Lots over the duration of the framework in terms of Centro spend or spend incurred by the various organisations that can access and order directly from the framework. It is not the intention that Centro uses the framework to procure on behalf of other organisations rather that other public bodies have access to it and procure directly from the qualified suppliers for the Lot(s) concerned.

Please note that this is a one stage process where bidders will be asked to submit a PQQ at the same time as submitting their bid for the Lot(s) concerned (only 1 PQQ submission is required regardless of how many ITT's are being submitted). Only those responses that meet the minimum PQQ criteria will go on to have their tenders evaluated. 

All correspondence, submissions and communications in relation to this Framework Agreement should be conducted via BravoSolution, Centro's e-tendering portal (https://centro.bravosolution.co.uk). The references for Centro's PQQ and ITT documents in BravoSolution are as follows:
