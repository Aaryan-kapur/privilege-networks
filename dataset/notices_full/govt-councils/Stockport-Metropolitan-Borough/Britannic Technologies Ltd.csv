The solution must: be capable of running enough concurrent (infinite) instances to cover all our chat needs; be able to integrate with Verint via APIs; be customisable to fit our online ecosystem; be accessible; be capable of running 24/7 without supervision; have skills-based routing for more complex queries during Contact Centre opening hours; have a dashboard; be capable of running reports on chats; be compatible with a variety of devices and operating systems; be capable of learning new content or new ways of communicating (e.g. learn new slang); use natural language processing (i.e. not be an IVR-type chatbot system); avoid having to set up questions in a bespoke manner; read the website and deliver updated content to users (to avoid duplication of effort maintaining a separate knowledge base).",,,"North West","48000000 ","Natalie McCarthy",natalie.mccarthy@star-procurement.gov.uk,"1FE Trafford Town Hall",,MANCHESTER,M320TH,England,,,,,,10/01/2019,06/01/2020,09/01/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,37400,37400,09/01/2019,37400,"[Britannic Technologies Ltd|Merrow Business Park Guildford
