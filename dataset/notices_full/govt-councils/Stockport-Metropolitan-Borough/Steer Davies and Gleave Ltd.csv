These schemes seek to improve access to Heathrow Airport for both business, leisure travellers and airport workforce, by improving rail connectivity to the airport.

As part of the CP5 settlement funding was agreed to progress the Western rail link (WRLtH) through a Development Consent Order, with the aim of commencing construction work during CP6. Southern access (SRLtH) is at an earlier stage of development and funding is currently being sought to undertake a GRIP 1-2 study.

Recent work to assess the wider network capacity and capability alongside the existing Heathrow infrastructure has revealed that, given the level of services expected to be operating to Heathrow Terminal 5 by December 2019, there will be no platform availability for future HRA services. This issue could be resolved by bringing platforms 1 & 2, which are currently within a safeguarded station box at Terminal 5, into use. The options and costs for fitting out the station box at Terminal 5 have not previously been considered by the Department or Network Rail.

The purpose of this work is to provide an independent view on the cost and fit out of the station box. This is required in order to inform part of our negotiating brief for a contribution from Heathrow Airport Limited. We have been clear publicly that progressing WRLtH is dependent on agreeing an appropriate contribution from the airport and this is critical to supporting our efforts to ensure the schemes are affordable and value for money. There is a critical dependency on this work as the contribution negotiations and accompanying 'funding statement' for the scheme need to be completed in time to inform the DCO submission.",,,London,"73200000 ",,DFTprocurement@dft.gsi.gov.uk,"Great Minster House,76 Marsham Street",,LONDON,SW1P4DR,England,,,"181219 - PPRO 04101125 signed award letter_Redacted.pdf ",,,13/11/2017,28/02/2018,02/11/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,50000,,03/11/2017,50000,"[Steer Davies & Gleave Ltd|28-32 Upper Ground

      1 Introduction 
      2 Transport for the South East (TfSE) is a newly established shadow sub-national transport body representing 16 Local Transport Authorities (LTAs) and five Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) in the South East .  
      
      3 The aim of TfSE is to support and grow the economy in the South East by identifying and prioritising a programme of strategic transport interventions. It also aims to improve the experience of the travelling public and businesses and bring about more reliable journeys free of congestion, whilst safeguarding the environment.   
      
      4 The key mechanism for expressing how TfSE will realise its vision and strategic priorities will be through its transport strategy to provide the basis for making recommendations on priorities for transport investment in the region. A route map for the development of the transport strategy has been produced setting out the work packages that will need to be completed to produce the transport strategy. 
      
      5 The initial stage of the transport strategy route map is an economic connectivity review.  This is intended to build on existing evidence and previous studies to provide an overarching view of the region's economic geography and functionality and transport's role within it. Critically, it will ensure that the transport strategy is grounded in the key issues around the economic impact of improved connectivity recognising that the region comprises a range of distinct functional economic areas. 
      
      6 This Invitation to Tender is being issued as a Further Competition under Lot 5 Highways Transport and Logistics of ESPO's Consultancy Services Framework (reference 664_17) to undertake the economic connectivity review.
