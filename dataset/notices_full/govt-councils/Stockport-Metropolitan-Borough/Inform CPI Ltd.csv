From April 2013 new provisions were applied under the Governments Localism agenda for the retention of Business Rates. Cheshire East Borough Council therefore require the services from a Service Provider to carry out a review of our Business Rates list and to help with the identification of additional Business Rates.
The service required from the Service Provider is to identify additional Rateable Value (RV) in the rating list. This could include businesses where RV values are too low (business has changed, expanded etc) or where new businesses are not included in the current rating list, and will increase RV for the Authority. This will maximise income through the collection of Business Rates from the additional RV once the District Valuer has revalued/valued the premises.

      Business Rates localisation presents a variety of challenges for local authorities in relation to the calculation and forecasting of the various elements of the business rates retention scheme.  As an authority participating in the rates retention pilot scheme in Sandwell we currently retain 100% of the income generated through Business Rates.  
      
      It is crucial that we are able to manage our rating list effectively, forecast changes which may affect net collectable debit and maximise growth through the early identification of commercial properties in the area.
      
      Rates avoidance is a serious concern especially in the current climate and it is important that efforts are made to validate reductions applied as much as possible.  In Sandwell large numbers of hereditaments receive Small Business Rates Relief but this will no longer apply if a company/organisation has more than one business in the same name.  
      
      Sandwell MBC therefore require a company who can provide:
      o Revenues Forecasting
      o RV Finder
      o Small Business Rates Relief Audit
      
      The contract duration is for 4 years from 14 April 2020 - 13 April 2024.
