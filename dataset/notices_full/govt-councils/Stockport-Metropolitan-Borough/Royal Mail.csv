London Borough of Newham and London Borough of Havering have expressed an interest in accessing services through this framework.

This includes energy master planning for combined heat and power, district heating and decentralised power opportunities for Reading. 
      
      Reading Town Centre is experiencing an accelerated development growth and there is consideration for Decentralised Heating in a number of schemes (eg. Kenavon Dr L&Q, Station Hill and Royal Mail) but more work needs to be done in terms of options for location of Energy Centres and potential for connectivity. 
      
      Heat networks have been identified by the UK government as an important part of the UK's future low carbon energy supply. They are particularly well suited to areas with high density and diverse potential consumers.  
      
      The development of heat networks is also viewed as a way of addressing issues around security of energy supply, reduction of fuel poverty, economic development and the creation of a potential revenue stream.
