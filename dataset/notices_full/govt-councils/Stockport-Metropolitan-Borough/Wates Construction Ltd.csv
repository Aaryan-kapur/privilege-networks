Cheshire Fire Authority (CFA) - Modernisation Programme Phase 2.
Following the success of building 4 new Fire Stations at Alsager, Lymm, Powey Lane and Penketh Cheshire Fire Authority (CFA) is looking to invest in the modernisation and re-modelling of 21 of their Fire Stations to bring them up to a standard closer to the new builds. Tarporley and Bollington fire stations have been contracted to Cruden Construction group (via the Procure North West Lite Framework) to drive progress in the programme, this leaves 19 fire stations over the 5 year programme.
The Stations are located across the Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service area and vary in size, form of construction and date, these being from the 1960's to 1990's.
In January 2017 CFA commissioned condition surveys of all its stock, and this has identified that some of our Station are looking aged and in need of modernisation to extend their lifespan and make them a more suitable pleasant environment to work from. 
Following the completion of the condition surveys, a report was presented to the Authority and funding for a 5 year modernisation programme has been approved to the sum of £8.5m, with £3.5m being released at this stage.
The programme will include some development of a Cheshire Fire Service Corporate Image that will be used in some of the remodelling of Station frontages etc.

Procure North West Framework Suppliers in Lot 2 who responded to the  Project Initiation Form - Fire Station Modernisation Programme - Phase 2 CPA/SPU/1230F - Cheshire Fire Authority and expressed interest were invited to quote/mini-competition.   

The £165,653.87 value relates to the JCT Pre-Construction Services Agreement  dated 7/8/19 for the pre-construction works required in Year 1. The value of work awarded as the works progress will include the  agreed Design & Build contracts/values for the works required each year - and the associated pre-construction works for each year - This contract covers works in Phase Two/Years 1 -5.

Hyde wants to become synonymous with creating beautifully designed homes where people want to live, which are socially and economically successful and with quality placed at the heart of what we do. Our customers rightly demand high standards of quality and finish -whatever price they may pay for their home. This can range from a subsidised rent of 150 GBP per week rent through to 1 000 000 GBP purchase price for an apartment. The scope of works required will differ under each call-off contract, but the programme primarily covers new build residential works, with the possibility of some ancillary retail and commercial development. Successful contractors will be expected to work collaboratively with Hyde, and will be expected to have an understanding of delivering mixed tenure developments and providing added value.",,,"Any region","45210000 ",,procurementhelpdesk@hyde-housing.co.uk,"30 Park Street",,London,"SE1 9EQ",UK,+442032072570,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=466051008 ",,07/12/2019,05/12/2024,06/12/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,2000000000,,06/12/2019,2000000000,"[Buxton Building Contractors|Cedar House, 91 High St

The DfE offsite framework is being established to cultivate innovation and modernise the industry by increasing the adoption of MMC (modern methods of construction) offsite production in the market, in line with the government's commitment to MMC and its presumption in favour of offsite construction by 2019 across suitable capital programmes, where it represents best value for money.
The DfE has appointed 5 contractors to each Lot. 
Lot 1 is intended for the delivery of offsite built Secondary Schools and Secondary blocks of Gross Internal Area (GIA) 6,000 m2 and above throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 1 to deliver batches of primary school schemes. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 2 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 1 is expected to be a throughput of 15 secondary schemes per year. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any schemes and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under the Framework Agreement.
Lot 2 is intended for the delivery of offsite built primary school schemes and secondary blocks of GIA from 750 to 6,000+ m2 throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 2 to deliver secondary school schemes above 6,000 m2. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 1 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 2 is expected to be a throughput of 15 primary schemes per year,. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any Scheme Contract and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under any Scheme Contract, or in aggregate under the Framework Agreement.
