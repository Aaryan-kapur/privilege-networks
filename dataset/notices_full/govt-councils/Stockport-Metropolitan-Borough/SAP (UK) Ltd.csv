Powerdesigner is a leader in Data Modelling space, providing conceptual, logical and physical data models. NHS Digital have a complex heterogenous data landscape and we need a tool that can 'make sense' of the data at rest (data models).
The tool is used to provide:
•	Illustrative and textual representations of conceptual, logical and physical data models in the form of normalised ERD's via ERwin for e.g. or Graph, Triple Store, Key Value etc model representations 
•	Linking of models and meta data attributes and referenced modules/DDB's etc.
•	Cardinality, relationships and constraints between entities & data attributes including keys, uniqueness, references, checks
•	Relationships of information assets (assets), data attributes which create modules, DDB's or collections (entities)
•	Catalogue of models, modules, entities, data attribute groups linked, possibly related etc but re-useable
•	Information about why, how and what entities and data attributes are associated, referenced, linked etc to create modules, DDB's etc
•	Analytical models etc based upon data models of entities, data attributes
The justification, for a single tender action, is that a contract could not be awarded following a procurement in 2017 and that a proof of concept in early 2018 demonstrated that further exploratory work should be conducted before a full requirement can be drafted, allowing for a competitive procurement to be conducted. This Tooling product has unique technical attributes to enable Beta work to be conducted.
