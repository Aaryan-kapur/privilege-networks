      The local Healthwatch service in Warwickshire will be representative of the diverse communities it serves. It will provide intelligence - including evidence from people's views and experiences - to influence the policy, planning, commissioning and delivery of publicly-funded health and social care services. It will also provide information to help people access and make choices about services as well as provide signposting to those who wish to make a complaint about NHS services.
      
      The local Healthwatch service in Warwickshire will be a robust and credible player in the local health and social care economy by demonstrating that it has the appropriate level of skills and competencies required to deliver its statutory functions. It will gain the trust of the general public as well as other health and social care stakeholder groups and organisations by being responsive, acting on concerns when things go wrong and being able to constructively challenge health and social care commissioners and providers.
      
      The seven key functions of the local Healthwatch Service are:
      
      1. Gather views and experiences of patients and the public
      2. Make these views known, both locally and nationally as appropriate
      3. Promote and support involvement in commissioning of health services and provision of care services
      4. Recommend investigation or special review of services via Healthwatch England or directly to the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
      5. Provide advice and information about access to services and support for making informed choices
      6. Make known the views and experiences of people to other local Healthwatch organisations and Healthwatch England and provide a steer to help it carry out its role as a national champion

      Housing Related Support 4 key principles:
      
      1.  A service must aim to prevent and/or reduce the escalation of the client's 
           needs and act to protect and enhance their opportunity of wellbeing.
      
      2.  A service must support those who are in need and eligible as determined by
           a Care Act 2014  assessment to maximize their independence and to reduce
           their risk of needing long term and/or acute care.
      
      3.  A service must be targeted on people who are assessed as vulnerable to not
           being able to sustain their independence or gain their independence. 
           Vulnerability is likely to be identified through multiple needs (for example 
           homelessness and mental health issues or offending behaviour) with one 
           main need being complicated by others or a combination of lower level 
           issues that together give cause for concerns in terms of ability to maintain 
           independence ('edge of care').
      
      4.  A Housing Related Support service should complement other services 
           provided and should represent an effective use of resources based on need.

This is to cover resource or skill capacity and to enable the upskilling of the internal team over time.

The framework will run for a maximum of 8 years with WMCA reserving the right to break the contract at year 4 and year 6. The reason behind the decision for an 8 year duration is that the provisions procured in this framework will support a future procurement (Transport Modelling) which is envisaged to be of equal length, for which a solid data collection and cataloguing are required. It is envisaged to appoint up to 5 suppliers per provision, however WMCA reserves the right to appoint a higher or lower number dependent on quality of submissions. Please note that the value is indicative as stated in the ITT documents.

-Additional Info - Primarily the incumbent supplier has been engaged to understand in detail how the existing contract is delivered. With regards to transport modelling there has been engagement with other bodies in the public sector to understand their approach. This has included Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council, the transport Systems Catapult and Highways England. 
The PIN notice 2016/S 189-338312 was published to OJEU on the 30 September 2016, and was intended to generate greater interest and lead to a supplier workshop to relay requirements and gather feedback prior to the contract notice in order to understand the ability of suppliers to meet the requirements. The supplier engagement day was held on the 18th November 2016 and attracted over 70 people from 45 companies. This was an early opportunity to present the intentions of the JDT re-let and gather feedback from the market about the approach we should take to deliver our aims and objectives at the right price in a competitive environment.The number of question received was considerable and the answers were broadcasted to all the suppliers along with the presentation files in a message sent via Bravo on the 01/12/2017, and subsequently on an individual basis to any suppliers who expressed a late interest in the open day.",,,"West Midlands","48613000 ",,procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,https://www.wmca.org.uk/,,"https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk/esop/toolkit/opportunity/opportunityDetail.do?opportunityId=33142&oppList=CURRENT http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:334418-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML http://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:028965-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML ","This Framework is procured on behalf of WMCA Constituent Authorities (City of Birmingham Council, the City of Coventry Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Solihull Borough Council, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council and Wolverhampton Borough Council or any of them as the context shall require) who will not require a Joining Agreement to access the services of the framework.
