MT162011,Contract,"Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council",Awarded,2015-10-07T08:52:40Z,"Joint - Gypsy & Traveller Needs Assessment","Local Planning Authorities are required by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) published March 2012, the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and the Housing Act 2004 to meet the accommodation needs of the population within their areas. This includes the needs of gypsy and traveller communities and that of Travelling Show-people.
Due to the lapse of time since a needs assessment was undertaken, it is considered prudent, in light of new national planning policy guidance (""Planning Policy for Traveller Sites"" published in March 2012), to replace the needs assessment. Also, paragraph 158 of the National Planning Policy Framework states that LPAs should ensure their Local Plans are based on adequate, up to date and relevant evidence about the (social) characteristics of their areas.
Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council are therefore seeking to obtain quotations for this assessment which will inform housing and spatial planning policy. The assessment will be jointly commissioned for the following authorities:-
- Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council;
- Stafford Borough Council;
- Staffordshire Moorlands District Council; and
- Stoke-on-Trent City Council.
Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council will lead on the commissioning of the assessment.",,,"West Midlands","90712000 90712100 90712500 71410000 ","Helen Beech (Planning Policy Manager)",helen.beech@newcastle-staffs.gov.uk,"Civic Offices,"," Merrial Street,",Newcastle-under-Lyme,"ST5 2AG",England,"+44 01782742477",www.newcastle-staffs.gov.uk,,"http://www.mytenders.org/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=OCT115631 ",,17/09/2014,17/09/2015,08/09/2014,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,15995,,22/09/2014,15995,"[Arc4 Limited|41 Clarendron Road, , Sale|||No|No]",,17/09/2014,17/09/2015,"Open ",
