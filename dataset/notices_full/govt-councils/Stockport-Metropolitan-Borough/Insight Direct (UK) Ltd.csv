Our ambition is to move away from a system of simply recording information to one which adds value for the employee, the manager and for Ofwat. 

The People hub delivers and facilitates the implementation of HR practices and people policies throughout the organisation either directly or through others such as our resource managers (RMs) and strategic resource managers (SRMs). The HR service provides transactional HR alongside HR business partnering delivered through the people partners and administrator(s). The system should be capable of supporting the move to greater employee and manager self-service, in a way which that is not burdensome to the end user. Our future HR system should be intuitive and offer a range of HR transactions at the touch of a few buttons. The system should be designed to meet user needs and wants, able to accommodate our people processes. 

Within the scope of Fit for the Future (F3) Programme is the implementation of a new HR system. The contract on the current system expires in January 2018. 

The project will have four broad phases:
1.	Business requirements gathering (completed);
2.	Procurement
3.	Design / development

      Surrey County Council has the objective to become an intelligence-led organisation, able to respond effectively to our strategic challenges. To achieve this objective we need to use a new generation of data analytics tool and provide this across the entire organisation.
      
      A Data Discovery / Data Visualisation tool will allow us analyse and visualise data faster to make more comprehensive and evidence-based decisions, in real-time and without the level of effort currently expended. These tools can connect to hundreds of data formats, offer interactive reporting dashboards and help users to tell compelling, quantifiable stories using real-time data. 
      
      As part of Surrey's IMT Modern Worker programme, the decision was taken to investigate the benefits a data visualisation tool could offer and eventually Tableau was selected for the pilot. From September 2015 to April 2016 Surrey purchased a variety of licences to be used across 35 data analysts from multiple departments including IMT, Adults, Public Health, Transport and Property. The pilot was deemed to be extremely successful and now Surrey County Council would like to purchase an enterprise wide licence to expand the benefits to all Surrey departments and share and edit reporting with colleagues from East Sussex and Brighton and Hove County Councils under the Orbis partnership initiative. An enterprise wide licence is believed to be the most cost effective way to roll out licences across departments.",,"KT1 2DN","South East","48000000 ","Surrey County Council Procurement",myhelpdeskfinance@surreycc.gov.uk,"Penrhyn Road","Kingston upon Thames",Surrey,"KT1 2DN","United Kingdom",02085419000,www.surreycc.gov.uk,,,,27/03/2017,26/03/2020,28/02/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,16/03/2017,0,"[Insight Direct (UK) Ltd|Technology Building, Insight Campus, Terry Street, Sheffield, United Kingdom, S9 2BU|||No|No]","PS Tender Team",27/03/2017,26/03/2020,"Other ",
