The Legible Leicester project comprises a number of work-streams.

A dynamic parking guidance system which could also be utilised to inform motorists of other incidents, events or traffic related messages will further help manage traffic in and around Leicester.
As such the proposed Free Text VMS Car Park Signs will help achieve some of Leicester City Council's LTP3 transport objectives:
•	Reduce congestion.
•	Improve connectivity and access.
•	Improve air quality and reduce noise.
•	Reduce carbon emissions.
•	Improve quality of life.
