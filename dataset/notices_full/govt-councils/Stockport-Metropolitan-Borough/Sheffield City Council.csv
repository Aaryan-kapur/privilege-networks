The Council also invites quotations to provide a SPRUCE development engineer, which can be tendered for just as a separate item. This is a corner stone piece of technology to provide bus priority and other adaptive traffic control strategies across the city. Under the Department for Transport's UTMC research project UTMC01, ""Selected Vehicle Priority"" (SPRUCE), a prototype software tool was developed to allow engineers to devise and operate priority signal control strategies for selected vehicles. Operating on a PC, the tool triggers temporary changes to fixed time Urban Traffic Control (UTC) plans in response to external demands from detectors. The resulting data are transferred to a host UTC system for implementation via the host's communication network. Simulation tests and field trials have demonstrated the success of this approach within the Sheffield tram network. In 2003 Leeds City Council, who were the lead authority in the UTMC01 project, went through a full procurement process in accordance with European Union protocols to develop a re-engineered version of the prototype SPRUCE software, with considerably more capacity, speed and increased flexibility. TSEU Ltd won the contract to develop and market SPRUCE/STM. Leeds City Council has invested over £250,000 on this project.

Digital inclusion is a business priority for Sheffield City Council's Housing and Neighbourhoods Service and a significantly emerging agenda for the Council as a whole.  It is particularly relevant when considering the impact of Welfare Reform and maintaining the rent income to the Council. 
We know that we have around 16,000 tenants who meet the criteria for claiming Universal Credit and do not have the access, skills and/or ability to claim online.  We also know that circa 54.5% of social demographic group DE (semi-skilled & unskilled manual occupations, unemployed and lowest grade occupations) have no or limited access to online services which further exacerbates the social divide. 
Our main aim is to maximise the levels of digital inclusion within our communities to encourage tenants to access the opportunities available to them on-line as well as accessing public services more easily these range from Improved employment opportunities, higher levels of educational attainment, accessing cheaper goods and products. However, too often those who are excluded from these benefits are the very same people who are also disadvantaged according to most other social and economic measures.

The Enterprise Adviser Network, an initiative launched in 2015 through the national Careers and Enterprise Company, has been developed on strong evidence published by the Gatsby Foundation that employer encounters can significantly reduce the likelihood of a young person becoming NEET by helping to improve skills needed for employment and raising awareness of the opportunities in the world of work.

The programme helps to 'join the dots' between educators and employers at a local level.  Its ambition is to simplify engagement between schools, colleges and employers and support the development of a whole school careers plan that includes 7 employer encounters for every young person whilst in education.

Enterprise Advisers are volunteers drawn from industry (businesses and the public sector, organisations of all sizes including the self-employed) who are matched to a secondary/special school or a college/sixth form to help the education organisation to improve their whole school world of work curriculum and employer links.

They are supported by Enterprise Coordinators who are co-funded by The Careers & Enterprise Company and Sheffield City Council who are partnering with The Careers & Enterprise Company in this national programme.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","80000000 ","Adam Elwis",adam.elwis@sheffield.gov.uk,"Level 8","East Wing, Moorfoot",Sheffield,"S1 4PL",England,"+44 1142053152",https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=d22fa417-26fe-e811-80f0-005056b64545 ",,02/01/2019,31/08/2019,20/12/2018,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,20617,20617,24/12/2018,20000,"[Giraffe Learning|s6 4rl|NONE||Yes|No]","Mrs Liz Yoxall",02/01/2019,31/08/2019,"Open ",

Sheffield was one of the first cities to launch the Bikeability Cycle training scheme in 2007.  This cycle training standard aims to equip people with the skills to negotiate Sheffield's increasingly busy roads. 	
The reduction of cycling casualties is part of the South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership ETP Action Plan. In 2015 50 cyclists under 16 were injured on South Yorkshire's roads. 43 with slight injuries whilst 7 sustained serious injuries. We are particularly concerned about those cyclists aged 10-15 who are most likely to be involved in an accident. The majority of these tend to be boys. 
The cycle accidents involving children are mainly as a result of children:
•	not paying attention when crossing the road 
•	riding into the road off of the pavement
•	right of way violations.  

The Bikeability training should highlight to the children of Sheffield the causes outlined above of their cycling accidents and ensure that children are given the skills and understanding to prevent them from becoming another of our statistics.
This level 1/2 & 3 cycle training aims to address these issues and encourage more children to cycle more safely across the city.

The objective of this project is to enhance the appearance of the building and surrounding location as part of the overall improvement of this area of the City Centre, address issues with the existing building and enable the installation of retail units to the ground floor.\r
The building is situated in a prominent location and consists of vacant retail and entertainment units on the ground floor, an NCP Car park located on the floors above and student accommodation in the tower block above the Car park.\r
It has been ascertained that the existing fibreglass panels and associated fixings to the Charter row elevation are in a poor state of repair and it is has been deemed that refurbishment of the existing units would be uneconomical. The preferred solution is to replace these panels with Aluminium fin 'wave' feature cladding, which will be designed and installed by the Contractor as part of this Contract. This cladding will also be installed to the Wellington Street elevation. There will also be painting and cleaning works to the existing parking decks, barriers, railings, windows, vents and concrete frames. There will be isolated repointing.\r
Aluminium 'Goal Post' cladding will be designed and installed to shop fronts on the ground floor, although all shop frontage within these frames will be installed through a subsequent programme of works. It should be noted that Asbestos removal and strip out works will have been undertaken to the ground floor units prior to commencement of these works.\r
The scheme also includes feature lighting, fencing and gates to be designed to match the Aluminium fin 'wave' cladding. The Contractor will design and install these items.\r
The Contractor shall be responsible for the development of the design proposals accepted as part of their tender to enable construction, including obtaining planning permission and building control approval.\r
The works are to be undertaken in occupied premises, with the student accommodation and car park remaining operational during the contract period. The Contractor must allow sufficient access to residents and car park users to allow these sections of the building to function.\r
To complete the works, the Contractor will be allowed to close a limited number of car parking spaces as detailed under clause 1.3.9.\r

The PKW approach is focussed on early help and community based prevention activity to improve people's health and wellbeing.  It is based on the principles and techniques that are known as social prescribing.

The 4 year work programme indicates the potential land area to be maintained year on year but this is only indicative as a number of external factors could impact on when land is required for disposal and/or development. 

The Cleared Sites contractor will be responsible for the management and maintenance of Council-owned cleared sites (predominantly housing demolition sites) across the city. The contractor in place will ensure that the sites are kept well-maintained, tidy and safe and do not have a detrimental impact on local residents and other users of the areas in the vicinity of these sites. 

There are approximately 60 hectares of cleared space (virtually all Housing land) being maintained under the current contract, spread across approximately 50 sites all over the city.

Anyone can call in it any time (there is no referral programme or waiting list), and any site may be called in at regardless of where the individual lives.

The Social Café scheme will also provide a programme of activities and events that will encourage people to participate in a wider range of activities. It shall provide information that enables people to access services more effectively and to manage their specific conditions.

This commissioned activity is targeted at people who are one or two steps away from having a level of need that makes them eligible for social care support with an individual budget; for people who are struggling with anxiety, depression, panic attacks or other mental health conditions. This target group will benefit from   opportunities to meet with others, in a structured scheme that will reduce their isolation and enable them to manage their lives and conditions better.  This should reduce the need for further and more prolonged health and social care services. These activities are primarily, but not exclusively, targeted at working age adults.

The library garden was designed by Percy Cane and is of local historical importance. The Friends of Broomhill Library have secured funding to redevelop the library garden, however, until the garden is clear of masonry and the wall rebuilt no work can take place.  
 
The nursing home that adjoins the library garden is keen to reinstate the boundary wall as the Heras fencing securing the collapsed wall is reducing the amount of car parking space for the nursing home. 
 
Investigations by a Structural engineer and a CCTV drainage survey of both the library and adjacent nursing home site have identified probable causes of the collapse as:  
  
- A very large established tree behind the wall on the neighbouring properties land has been pushing on the wall as well as its root system mechanically interacting with the wall and its foundations 
 
- Some recent repointing work has increased the weight marginally on the garden face of the wall. This has limited water from draining through the wall on the retained side increasing the water pressure in the retained material. 
 
- The CCTV drainage survey identified a broken land drain on the nursing home grounds.  Water from this drain has been leaking under the wall. 
 
Works to remove the tree and repair the drain have been undertaken prior to these works being tendered.  
 
The works to reinstate the wall include the demolition of some of the existing wall that is bowing, cleaning and preserving the existing stone for re-use where possible, excavation and casting a new increased footing, and rebuilding of the wall to include a wider construction in part to form a retaining structure and the introduction of weep holes.  
 
It will also be necessary to remove, protect and reinstate some original stone features during the course of the works.  
 
Due to the proximity of the site to neighbouring property there will be a requirement to undertake some facilitating works on the land of the adjacent residential home including works to reinstate any disruption caused to neighbouring property during the course of the works.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","45223200 45262300 45262500 45262522 45262330 ","Lisa Oxley",cds@sheffield.gov.uk,"Capital Delivery Service","Level 3, East Wing, Moorfoot",Sheffield,"S1 4PL","United Kingdom",,https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/,,,"The Suitability Assessment and Tender Documents are now available to download by logging into YORtender and searching for the job reference number SHEFCC001-DN474681-94247633.
