Short breaks not only provide a break for parents and carers, but can also lead to a better quality of care being provided. This results in better outcomes not only for the disabled child, but for the whole family. This includes reduced family breakdown and reduced likelihood of requests for residential school provision. The provision of short breaks also supports the Council's approach to meeting the needs of children with complex needs and reducing the need for high cost out of borough placements.
The service will be tendered in two lots
Lot 1Group Based Short Breaks 
Lot 2 Outreach Short Breaks

The service must be delivered onsite or near to Who Dares Works delivery in community-based venues across the whole of West Cornwall and be flexible enough to cater for fluctuating numbers of children according to the number of participants attending.

Who Dares Works is a project funded by the European Social Fund and the National Lottery through the Big Lottery Fund. It is led and managed by Active Plus Community Interest Company and delivered through a partnership of 17 social enterprises. 

The aim of Who Dares Works is to help and inspire people aged 18 and over who are not working, who live in West Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly and who have a range of needs or barriers to overcome, to reconnect with education, training and work. The project is funded until 31 December 2019. Delivery is likely to finish by 31 October 2019.

The requirement for MAST is detailed below for indicative purposes.  This may be subject to change and some flexibility is required due to the nature of the requirement. For example numbers of children attending crèche may go up or down with little notice. This would require the provider to be flexible with the amount of crèche workers provided.

1386LaunchPad,Contract,"FALMOUTH EXETER PLUS",Awarded,2020-02-24T16:20:48Z,"Provision of Technical Outsourcing for App and Website Development","Launchpad is an innovative incubator of high-growth, high-tech companies based in Cornwall. This procurement is for a team based within the Launch-Pad incubation programme, who are developing an app for the attraction sector to enable the tracking and monitoring of visitors. We intend to procure technical outsourcing for this incubating team, and this RFQ specifies the requirements for such quotes.

Launchpad is a pre-seed incubator, which recruits individuals into complementary teams of 4. We bring together business people, software developers and digital media creatives to build new high-growth companies. These founding teams spend 2-3 months selecting the concept of their product based on market research, engagement with partners of the programme, and sometimes early user engagement. The rest of a year is spent building a business and a product to meet the market need that they have identified. At the end of the year, the teams seek investment to take their businesses to market, and grow at a high rate.
The programme has identified that the team in question does not have the relevant technical expertise in the team.  The team has created a strong business case for the app, and have lined up an attraction to trial the app with. The team have developed the user stories required for the app and scoped the outsourcing required for a proof of concept app. It is our belief that this team requires technical outsourcing to enable them to grow the business.	Build an application to work on iOS and Android mobile phones that can track, monitor and predict where visitors will be at an attraction. The app will provide an interactive map of the core exhibits for visitors to engage with and personalised trails and offers to shift visitor flow. For example, a visitor with children would be sent an in-app notification offering discounted kids lunch boxes at 11am to avoid the peak rush at 12noon for lunch in the canteen.	Build an analytics dashboard optimised for the Google Chrome browser only, for the attraction staff to track visitors. This will be visible via an interactive heat map showing where crowded areas are. The dashboard will also allow the Launch-Pad team to manually send personalised offers to visitors to shift visitor flow",,,"South West","48983000 ",,procurement@fxplus.ac.uk,"Penryn Campus",,PENRYN,TR109FE,England,"01326 253504",,"1386Launch-pad Technical Outsourcing for App and Website Development.docx ","https://in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofexeter/aspx/Home ","Stage 1 - Expression of Interest and signing of Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA)
