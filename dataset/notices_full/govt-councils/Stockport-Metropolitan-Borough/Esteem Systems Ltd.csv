The Council's existing core infrastructure (storage, compute and backup) hardware and software is reaching end of life. The Council therefore has a requirement to replace existing storage, compute and backup systems with new solutions. Around 95% of current workloads are virtualised using VMware ESXi. The Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform has been identified as the technology of choice in order to replace existing storage and compute hardware underpinning this virtualisation environment. The Council has a number of workloads that will not be migrated to the Nutanix solution (Oracle Solaris based systems and File Shares) that consume legacy SAN storage.
