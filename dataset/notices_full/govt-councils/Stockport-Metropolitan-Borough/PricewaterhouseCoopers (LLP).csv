In fulfilling our statutory duties we must ensure the skills and expertise are available to undertake any assessment as it occurs and to mitigate the impact on customers. This call off contract will form part of our risk mitigation and management strategy.
This call off Contract follows a Phase 1 call off Contract previously procured in February 2018 for short term support to deliver specific work in relation to financial resilience of the companies which we regulate.
We now seek to put in place a wider long term arrangement for the provision of specialist advisory services which may result in one of the areas of work set out in the overall objectives and scope sections of this document. We seek to ensure that we have the necessary support in place to allow us to respond to issues which may impact on a company's financial resilience including matters of financial distress and special administration as well as support in other areas where we might have to assess Merger or Acquisition. 
The requirement is divided up into 4 workstreams:
Workstream 1: Financial Resilience - Analysis of a company's financial position and any possible interventions that may be required
Workstream 2: Financial Distress - An entity has a known issue and are likely to be close to or in a position of financial distress
Workstream 3: Special Administration - Providing advice to Ofwat where a company is the subject of a Special Administration order
Workstream 4: Other Workstreams - Analysis of complex transactions/infrastructure procurement and delivery and/or assessment of an Interim Determination of K (IDoK), a mid-period price review action to adjust prices for the current price control period. 
To assist in our planning, we propose a call off contract with multiple Contractors with a sufficiently wide scope to cover a range of scenarios, who have demonstrated they should be awarded the Contract through the evaluation process. The number will be dependent on the quality of the bids. This is to mitigate against any conflicts of interest and capacity issues.
Contractors are able to bid for one or more workstreams. We are looking to appoint up to 4 Contractors for each workstream, who are best suited to supply services for the particular workstream. However, the final number will be dependent on the quality of the bids which may mean the number of appointed Contractors may be greater or lower than stated. The section on call off of Services outlines the process for activation of the call off.   
The Contract term will be for TWO years from Contract commencement date with an option for a ONE year extension. Framework rates are to be fixed for the initial 2 years of the Contract. 

Please refer to the ITT for more information.

2.	What is the impact of AI on individual occupations? What occupations would be in demand given AI? 
3.	What is the impact of AI on those specific skills which are currently in shortage in the UK? 
4.	What are most probable occupation trends, ie new occupations, in the future?  
5.	What is the impact on labour market by short/ medium/long term?

Objectives
The transition from the Cirrus programme to the IT TOM is planned for the coming months and as such BEIS / DIT are seeking support to provide an effective, independent assurance function to support the decision-making process.  

This will enable the BEIS / DIT internal management team to focus and address all key risks in the succesful delivery of the IT TOM and delivery of the outcomes detailed in the business case.

Success of the Cirrus programme will depend on a successful roll-out to circa 5,900 users in London and across the UK, and an efficient transition of service delivery from the programme to the IT function.

One of the key objectives is to ensure the most appropriate IT Target Operating Model for Cirrus is implemented with an effective, ongoing service delivery function, at the right cost.

•	The scope of this requirement covers the transition from the Cirrus programme to the IT target operating model. 
 
•	The period of external support will run from January 2018 - 31st March 2018.

•	All work undertaken as part of this contract will be pre-agreed and within scope of this requirement.

"FWRECR17133BEIS - Share Buybacks and Executive Pay",Contract,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",Awarded,2017-12-12T12:04:48Z,"FWRECR17133BEIS - Share Buybacks and Executive Pay","The overall purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between the use of share buybacks and executive remuneration. More specifically we would like to understand whether buybacks are being used (by design or accident) to artificially meet EPS targets in CEO pay contracts and/or to inflate the value of their share awards rather than to create long-tem value for the company.
As explained above, this work will:
•	deliver the Government's manifesto commitment ""to commission an examination of the use of share buybacks to ensure that they cannot be used artificially to hit performance targets and inflate executive pay"" that has been reaffirmed by the BEIS response to the Corporate Governance Reform green paper, published on 29th August. It will help government come to a conclusion on whether there exists a significant problem, if so what it is, and what further steps might be necessary; and
•	contribute to current work on corporate governance reform, executive pay and investor stewardship, including potentially influencing revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code and UK Stewardship Code.
The project should seek to answer the following questions:
•	To what extent have share buybacks (by design or accident) helped meet EPS and total shareholder return (TSR) targets? 
•	Are share repurchases used by executives to meet performance targets such as EPS and TSR, and to boost share based remuneration levels by creating (short-term) increases in share price? Does the academic literature suggest that the use of buybacks to meet targets is relevant to the UK?
•	Do performance targets such as EPS and TSR incentivise the use of share buybacks for myopic reasons that are not value creating for the company?
•	How important are performance related measures, such as, EPS and TSR to CEOs overall pay plan and how has this evolved over time? 
•	Does the United States regulatory framework on buybacks and the typical pay structure for US CEOs result in a stronger use of buybacks to manipulate executive pay in the US than in the UK, or does the evidence suggest that these problems exist in the UK to a similar degree?
The work should aim to answer these questions by examining the existing literature and by carrying out its own analysis based on up-to-date UK-specific data. It should also analyse the different regulatory frameworks in the US and the UK, and assess to what extent the existing US evidence applies to the UK (please refer to the section ""Suggested Methodology"" for more detail on the three suggested components of the project).
The successful bidder may also indicate what basic steps could be taken to avoid share buybacks being misused to inflate executive remuneration, should the analysis suggest that this was indeed the case. This additional step is though optional.

PROC.01.0558,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2017-08-30T14:43:12Z,"How efficient are retail services in the water sector compared to other sectors?","Objectives 
The objective of this work is to inform our PR19 approach to assess the current efficiency of residential retail services- in England and Wales in the water sector through comparison with other sectors, in advance of the 2019 price review. The work will focus on the assessment of bad debt, debt management and customer service costs (bill handling and call centre costs) of water companies. Data on bad debt, doubtful debt, revenue recovery and revenue written off is available at Ofwat database. We expect the contractor to produce a report and provide recommendations that are practical to implement in PR19.

Scope and Key Tasks
The project consists of two work packages: 
Work package 1: assessment of bad debt levels and bad debt management practice

The Contractor will assess the efficiency of bad debt levels and bad debt management practices in the water sector relative to other sectors. 
-	Assess bad debt levels and trends in the water sector and how they compare to other sectors. 
-	If levels are higher than in other sectors, to what extent is it due to factors within company control or beyond company control? Would better company management practices in the water sector reduce level of bad debts? 
-	Identify efficient level of bad debts in the sector, based on comparison with other sectors and evidence on revenue collection and debt management practices.
-	Review revenue collection and debt management practices in the water sector and make recommendations on how these can be improved.
-	Develop an assessment framework for Ofwat that can be used at PR19 to help inform our view of the efficiency of water companies in managing revenue recovery and bad debts. 
-	Identify best practice with respect to debt management and recovery in other sectors. And provide recommendations for Ofwat on whether its guidelines on  dealing with customers in debt should be updated.

Phase 1

The scope of the work is to develop a business cycle map by:
	
i)	Carrying out a review of relevant documents (e.g. Board Rules of Procedure, Ofwat governance framework, UK codes on governance, government guidance, best practice).
ii)	Produce a robust business cycle map which is easy to understand and update, and can be made readily available across our business and identifies owners for each activity in the business cycle map. 
iii)	Once the business cycle has been developed, set out what processes/controls should be in place at key points along the cycle that provide further assurance of delivery of key components that make up the map. Some of these processes/controls may or may not already be in place. We expect the suggestions to be the most efficient and effective that can be utilised and include the public sector governance controls that need to be in place. 
iv)	Carrying out a review of the Ofwat assurance map (our high level control environment) to ensure it aligns with the developed business cycle map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

We expect that Phase 1 work will be delivered by 28 April 2017.

Phase 2
Following the successful delivery of Phase 1, we may extend the project with the successful Supplier. This will be dependent on what is delivered in Phase 1 and the scope will be discussed in more detail following delivery of Phase 1. This work will be charged at the same day rate as Phase 1. This will include:

i)	Reviewing current processes and controls for the events within the business cycle and provide a view on whether our processes and controls are appropriate and a view on whether any processes or controls can be streamlined to reduce unnecessary burden.
ii)	Identify any gaps in process/controls associated with the business cycle map and provide recommendations as to what we should include when filling those gaps.
We expect that Phase 2 work will carry on from the end of Phase 1 and should be completed by 30 September 2017.   

The outcome of Phase 2 should be a report which sets out recommendations for providing continual and firm assurance that relevant business cycle process/controls are in place and effective, whilst at the same time testing the level of burden and seeking to reduce this wherever possible. The outcome should provide further assurance for the production of the governance statement in our annual report and accounts.",,,"West Midlands,London","79410000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"R PROC 01.0548 - Signed by both parties_Redacted.pdf ",,,16/02/2017,30/09/2017,07/02/2017,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,55936,13/02/2017,55936,"[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP UK (PwC)|The Portland Building

•	Review the overall incentive framework for aligning company interests (including company management and investors) with customers now and in the long term.  This includes the setting of the single notional allowed return on capital, ODIs, cost outperformance, financing outperformance, as well reputational and procedural incentives associated with risk based review of business plans to consider whether this is most likely to allocate risk and align returns with best interests of customers.

•	Consider whether menu based differential on allowed return on equity would improve the overall incentive framework and what the implications might be for other elements of incentive package including outcome delivery incentives, totex and financing, if a differential cost of equity was to be introduced. Also consider whether a menu based differential in allowed return on equity would need to be modified to fit with overall incentive framework, in particular the outcome delivery incentives.

•	Consider desirability and feasibility of setting differential returns on equity for water and wastewater companes on basis of risk and/or ambition of company business plans. If feasible, recommend an approach as to  how a menu based approach cost of equity could be best implemented including how an appropriate differential in return could be set. This should include consideration of the impacts on the cost of equity in a 'lower for longer' interest rate scenario.

•	Provide recommendations on the overall balance of financial and other incentives to best align company with customer interest now and in the longer term. This should include an assessment of the overall balance of incentive mechanisms. It should consider and provide recommendations on the development of appropriate incentive mechanisms for PR19, which may include the evolution or replacement of, mechanisms that applied at PR14. 

•	Consider the implications of a lower for longer interest rate scenario on the cost of equity for PR19. This will consider whether the CAPM approach remains appropriate for setting the cost of equity in an environment of extremely low interest rates for total market returns, risk free rate and equity premium and for estimating the equity beta.

We would welcome further suggestions from Contractors on what else should be considered as part of this work.  
      
As part of this work the Contractor will also need to engage with us on outcomes and cost assessment work. The Contractor may also need to engage with companies individually, and potentially in a workshop in developing final proposals. We are separately appointing consultants to consider the future development of performance commitments and outcome delivery incentives and so the Contractor will also be required to liase with the consultants developing our approach to outcomes in developing its work on the balance of incentives and risk and reward.",,,"West Midlands,London","79410000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"R PROC 01.0533 - Signed by both parties.pdf ",,,29/11/2016,03/03/2017,07/11/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,138000,23/11/2016,138000,"[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP|7 More London Riverside

We need to be able to respond to issues we have identified as well as challenges and alternative approaches suggested by stakeholders. 

The objective of this work is for the successful contractor to provide advice, output and assurance on non-household price control issues that we identify. As the full extent of the issues are not yet known, consultants are asked to bid on basis of capability to deliver on one or more issues we identify in this dynamic environment. A key component of any successful bid will be the identification a suitable range of Contractors’ Staff (and their daily rates) that can be called on to provide the necessary support. 
Issues that we currently consider will require the successful contractor to provide support to include:

Cost to serve

A number of stakeholders have already challenged the cost to serve the non-household retail market as identified in our December 2014 price controls. It has been suggested that our proposed cost to serve is too low and that comparisons with retail operators in other sectors, notably energy, would demonstrate this. 

Simplification of water and waste water default tariff caps

Companies must be able to demonstrate that their default tariffs comply with the relevant price controls. However, there are a relatively large number of individual default tariff caps (circa 250), to some extent reflecting variations in underlying tariff structures. Companies have also taken different approaches to allocating costs and margins to their default tariff caps. Taken together this creates complexity and a lack of comparability (which might hinder the development of competition).  We are therefore considering whether we should simplify the structure of the default tariff caps. 

The work would need to be carried before the end of March 2016 to support the publication of a method statement in April 2016 and the publication of draft and final determinations later in 2016. 

While the scope of this work is defined above, it is worth noting that this work is one element of a larger work programme we are undertaking, and we may need to seek further support on related issues as 2016 progresses.",,,"West Midlands,London","73000000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,,,"For further information, please contact:  procurement@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk ",18/01/2016,31/03/2016,08/01/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,83333,,27/01/2016,83333,"[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP|7 More London Riverside

The UK MOD's Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) organisation has a requirement to appoint a Managed Service Provider (MSP) to build upon, and embed its Human Resources (HR) management capability and to support cultural change within the DE&S workforce.
This requirement is part of the DE&S's wider Materiel Strategy change programme. Under the change programme, the DE&S organisation has been established as a Bespoke Central Government Trading Entity within the public sector from 1 April 2014, with new management freedoms and controls that are appropriate to its challenges and the specialist nature of its business.

Requirement

The MSP will be a key provider of the services/requirements driving the Materiel Strategy change programme. Potential MSPs should note that the DE&S is planning to appoint other MSPs for two further Work Packages – Work Package (WP) 1, Project Delivery to transform and improve the operation of its project delivery capability and Work Package (WP) 2, Finance/Management Information/Information Technology (Fin/MI/IT) to transform and improve the operation of its financial and information management capability.
Within the boundaries of the freedoms and controls given to DE&S as a Trading Entity and working with the MSPs of WPs 1 and 2 as necessary, it is considered that the requirements for the HR MSP are broadly split into 3 categories:
a) those associated with the design, establishment and embedding of a dedicated new Corporate HR Function within the boundaries of the freedoms and controls given;
b) those associated with the development, implementation and embedding of the employment policy and process framework; and
c) those associated with the DE&S workforce, including designing a HR strategy featuring a new workforce model to enable effective deployment of staff, building capability, and the delivery and embedding of a changed culture within the organisation.",,"BS34 8JH","South West","75220000 79400000 ",,DESCDM-MatStrat-CommercialTeam@mod.uk,"MoD Abbey Wood",,Bristol,"BS34 8JH",England,,,"20150703-MATSTRAT_0004_Redacted_Contract_Contract_Schedules-O.pdf 20150703-MATSTRAT_0004_Redacted_Contract_Main_Body-O.pdf ",,,17/11/2014,17/11/2017,17/11/2014,NO,,No,No,No,Services,61000000,,17/11/2014,61000000,"[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP|7 More London Riverside

About UK Shared Business Services 

Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.

It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It’s what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS’ goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.

Our Customers

Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.

UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14. 

Important information

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

These services require the supplier to draw upon a range of disciplines, experience and knowledge including government finance, budgeting, finance systems, technical accounting skills and project and programme management and delivery. 
MoJ has agreed to source this service by putting in place a framework agreement, which can also be accessed by the Home Office, HM Treasury and all of their associated arm’s length bodies. The framework will be established with up to 6 suppliers. 
Given the complex nature of change initiatives, the suppliers' multi-disciplinary teams are expected to comprise experienced professionals who have completed professional qualifications in their area of expertise. It is expected that the team provided will be solely dedicated to the engagement for its duration in order to support and prioritise effective delivery. The teams will be required to work alongside our internal teams and integrate effectively at our locations. The following core elements of the requirement are to be:

• Resource Delivery Model - Resources will be tasked with developing their own delivery plans as part of the engagement with change teams, ensuring plans meet overall delivery objectives. Resources will be responsible for delivering to agreed milestones and providing the relevant project input to programme and portfolio oversight teams. 
• Technical Accounting Expertise - Resources shall be expected to provide expert technical knowledge, research, expertise and support to change teams, have relevant and up-to-date technical knowledge of the broader financial regulatory frameworks, and be well versed in Government reporting and budgeting regulation. 
• Advocacy - Resources will be expected to embed full-time alongside existing change teams to proactively identify issues, highlighting implications and proposing suitable solutions or alternative methodology to achieve required outcomes. Resources will be expected to engage and influence internal and external stakeholders to drive issues through to conclusion. 
• Finance Improvement Activities - Resources will be expected to identify and implement finance improvement activities, including system and process design, implementation and broader advice on the requirements for ongoing monitoring of activity, including how governance and assurance processes should operate to ensure the requisite level of senior management scrutiny is maintained. 
• Knowledge Transfer - Resources will be required to propose plans for increasing the skills of in-house staff and an agreed process to ensure knowledge transfer at the conclusion of work packages. Resources will also be required to demonstrate how they will make this happen and how they will deliver value for money both through their direct work and through the enhancement of in-house capability.",,,"South East","79200000 79400000 ","Charlotte Dodden",charlotte.dodden@justice.gsi.gov.uk,"Ministry of Justice","102 Petty France",London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,,23/09/2015,23/09/2018,09/06/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,20000000,50000000,23/09/2015,0,"[Allen Lane Consultancy Limited|30 City Road

PROC.01.0604,Contract,"WATER SERVICES REGULATION AUTHORITY",Awarded,2018-05-24T14:44:00Z,"Special Financial Support","In 2009 Special Administration legislation was introduced which covered Insolvency procedures for the Water Industry.  In effect this covers Insolvency procedures for the Water companies.  
In practice, we have never had to use the special administration arrangements and have no reason to believe that we will need to do so in future.   

We have an ongoing project to review the procedures for Special Administration and for water companies experiencing financial distress (which could lead to Special Administration).  This is an enduring piece of work, and we have previously run exercises internally and discussed arrangements with key stakeholders as part of our normal preparation.  As part of the project, we are looking to develop a call off contract for consulting support to ensure we have specialist assistance if needed.  This is a precautionary measure.  It will provide an additional safeguard for our prudent risk management processes.

The call off contract will be a phased implementation:

Phase 1
Phase 1 will be a call off contract for FOUR months with an option for a TWO month extension.  It will have TWO suppliers - a PREFERRED supplier and a RESERVE supplier.  The PREFFERED supplier will would be chosen to lead any work.  However if the PREFFERED supplier was  unable to support (for example through a professional conflict of interest such as being a statutory auditor to the company concerned) we would opt for the RESERVE supplier.

Phase 2
A longer term call off contract will be developed in 2018.  Information relating to this will be provided nearer the time.
The rest of this ITT is concerned with Phase 1 only.

Overall Objectives
In very broad terms financial distress refers to a company experiencing problems paying its creditors.  Special Administration is a form of insolvency - where the company cannot pay its creditors and has formally gone into receivership.  

In our context financial distress is the precursor to Special Administration.  We would want to avoid a formal route of special administration where possible.  

Should a supplier be appointed under the Phase 1 call off contract, the objectives shall be:

•	Provide OFWAT support for a company experiencing:
(a)	financial distress; AND/OR
(b)	that has triggered the Special Administration Procedures

•	Provide Ofwat with support and advice on financial and corporate issues at relatively short notice. This will include assessment of companies' financial positions, scenario analysis, and action plans;

•	Provide Ofwat with advice and support in dealing with potential financial distress at water companies including the approaches/actions/attitudes of external parties eg credit rating agencies, debt and equity investors; and

•	Provide Ofwat with technical financial advice in respect to financial, capital and corporate restructuring.",,,"West Midlands,London","79412000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gsi.gov.uk,"Centre City Tower","7 Hill Street",Birmingham,"B5 4UA",England,,,"PROC.01.0604 Signed by both parties Redacted.pdf PROC.01.0604 Contractor 2 Redacted.pdf ",,,26/03/2018,26/07/2018,09/03/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,180000,19/03/2018,0,"[Deloitte LLP|Athene Place
