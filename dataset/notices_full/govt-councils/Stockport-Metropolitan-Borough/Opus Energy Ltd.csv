The lead contracting authority for the tender was Shoreline Housing Partnership (Shoreline),  and the resulting framework agreement is managed by Inenco (one the UK’s largest energy consultancies), acting as the agent for the central purchasing body. 

The framework is to cover call-off contracts made within England, Scotland and Wales, but excludes Northern Ireland. The framework is available for use by all contracting authorities as defined by Regulation 2 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 #102, and is also available for use by all current and future members of the central purchasing body. Please see the Additional text section of this notice for further details. The final framework consists of 1 supplier per lot.

The ITT was issued in accordance with the Open Procedure under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 #102. The ITT set out the information which was required by the client in order to assess the suitability of suppliers in terms of their ability to deliver the requirements of the framework.

The client sought bids from suppliers to participate in an electricity and gas portfolio services framework, covering the following lots: 

Lot 1: Non-half hourly (NHH) electricity
Lot 2: Half hourly (HH) electricity
Lot 3: Gas

The framework agreement is to be four years in duration from the commencement date. 

The estimated value over the framework period is anticipated to be up to £488,000,000 excluding VAT, however this is an estimate only. The maximum levels of expenditure per lot are estimated to be as follows:

Lot 1: £200,000,000 over the framework period excluding VAT
Lot 2: £200,000,000 over the framework period excluding VAT
Lot 3: £88,000,000 over the framework period excluding VAT
