•	It is impossible to comply with the usual timescales in the Public Contract Regulations (2015) - there is no time to run an accelerated procurement under the open or restricted procedures or competitive procedures with negotiation, nor does the MDC have access to an existing commercial agreement such as a framework or dynamic purchasing system.

This will involve the ability to capture and link data through the NHS Health Check process ensuring associated pathways and data transfers take place legally and efficiently. 

The software solution is designed to support the process for both GP practices and third party providers delivering health checks in the community, and will support the operational process and monitor the performance and effectiveness of this programme. 

There will be a comprehensive suite of reporting and analytical tools to support the information requirements both locally and nationally.  

The successful bidder for the provision of the software will be expected to work with up to 30 practices and all community providers who support the local delivery of health checks.

The NHS Health Check IT solution will support the following requirements: 
•	Identification of the eligible populations for Derby City (The software must have a function to categorise the eligible population by their status in the Health Check process)
•	Assist GP practices and third party providers to deliver the programme, providing a solution to capture and link community health check data with GP practices.
•	Issue patient invitation letters on behalf of practices who have opted out of the NHS Health Check Programme
•	Provide programme activity and outcome reports for Derby City Council by GP practice and community provider.

Please note, suppliers wishing to express interest and obtain the documentation, must do so by 14:00 on 14/10/2016. It is recommended that you express interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit a comprehensive response.
