The register currently comprises of around 180,000 electors and produces monthly electoral registers for use by the Electoral Registration Officer's team, Political Parties and other organisations.

The system should be able to operate in line with changing guidance on Individual Electoral Registration (IER) which was first implemented in June 2014. We would like the system to link with Open Text (the Councils Document Management System) so that forms can be scanned to the Electoral system at point of receipt into the building. We also need the facility to bulk email / text electors where required to save paper forms going to households. The new system needs to have the flexibility to manage more efficiently the process of notifying electors of changes or the requirement to take action to register through electronic channels such as online sources, email and text messaging.

The system should also be capable of managing an election through Candidates and Agents details, nominations, staffing, production of poll cards, ballot papers and the management of the postal voting system. The system needs to link through Government Connect to external sites such as DWP, electoral roll and print service suppliers. Ideally the system should be capable of running / hosting a results service and publishing data relating to this via the Council's website.

Please note, suppliers wishing to express interest and obtain the documentation, must do so by 14:00 on 03/11/2016. It is recommended that you express interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit a comprehensive response.
