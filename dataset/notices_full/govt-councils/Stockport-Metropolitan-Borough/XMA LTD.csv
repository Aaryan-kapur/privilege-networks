To do the above capture, process and storage of data the machines need very fast
networking hence the need to support 2x 10Gb/s network ports at the moment, they
will need some very fast processors with a lot of ram to process the data, hence the
GPU's and the 256Gb of RAM and they will need some very fast data storage devices
hence the 240Gb SSD's being specified.
As technology improves faster CPU's GPU's memory and SSD's may become available
