A core component of this work is focused on supporting the Malawi Government to improve the quality of early grade mathematics teaching, so all children are supported to learn and master the basics. DFID Malawi intends to work with suppliers who are committed to improving the quality education in Malawi and strengthening government systems for long lasting sustainability.
      
      This programme aims to improve student learning outcomes in mathematics, so girls and boys have a solid foundation in basic skills to succeed in the rest of their schooling and fulfil their potential. By the end of the programme we hope this will contribute towards improved service delivery, so more girls and boys, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, progress through and complete primary school with measurable improvements in their learning outcomes. This component is part of a larger education programme. Other components include: (i) strengthening Malawi's education system by providing technical assistance to district councils to ensure they have the finance and human resource capacity to oversee primary schools and teachers, (ii) improving the availability and use of education data for evidence based policy and planning; (iii) and making the education system more equitable, by providing targeted support to marginalised girls to support them to finish primary school with improved learning outcomes and transition to secondary school.
      
      The supplier will provide technical assistance to facilitate the revision of the mathematics curriculum for lower primary (standards 1-4), develop corresponding teaching and learning materials, design teacher training strategies (including school-based support structures), rigorously pilot the new materials and training strategies, document impact, refine the materials and training strategies, and then oversee the national scale-up.

We will need to provide our responses within the 12 week statutory timeline.
This work will consist of a desk based review of each companies draft WRMP and supporting documentation to support the development of Ofwat's response to the statutory consultation. The Contractor will have access to our findings from pre-consultation to help prioritise resources. The review will be carried out using a proportionate and risk based approach. We expect this to take the form of a layer assessment process, with core questions - common across all companies, but with additional layers for medium and high risk companies. Our initial view is that we expect:

•	3-6 WRMPs to be high risk;
•	3-6 WRMPs to be medium risk; and
•	The rest to be low risk (including WRMPs for new appointees (NAVs))

We expect the tenders received to reflect these estimates but Contractors should include how they would revise their approach to a company's draft WRMP as the review progressed.

Highways England has a Midlands Regional Traffic Model [MRTM] that covers the whole West Midlands Conurbation and a wider area: this is not a model to which WMCA has presumed access rights but MRTM data was used in the building of PRISM 5. There are a small number of sub-conurbation highway network models in Saturn and numerous micro-simulation tools covering local areas; these models being owned by WMCA and the Constituent Authorities and operated by them or their modelling services suppliers. 
 Our most substantial and only conurbation-wide model is PRISM. This was built as a large strategic model intended to gain insight into strategic issues to inform policy and planning, but which has primarily been used to support business case development for large public transport schemes and the less frequent refreshes of local planning policy. It has evolved to do this well in the sense that business cases have been successfully produced and defended and local plans evidenced using the model have withstood planning inquiry examination and challenge. 
 The client group, comprising TfWM and the 7 Local Authorities, are seeking to appoint consultants for transport modelling services in the West Midlands. The appointed suppliers will apply, maintain and enhance PRISM 5 on behalf of the client group. A separate procurement activity is taking place in parallel to this tender to seek suppliers to support TfWM in the creation of our future modelling capability that will offer complementary modelling capabilities, some of which could supersede parts of the modelling functions offered by PRISM.

A2014157,Contract,Centro,Awarded,2015-06-30T10:18:19Z,"Professional Services Framework Agreement","Centro is seeking suitable consultants to qualify for its new Professional Services Framework Agreement that is due to commence on 1st October 2015 for a maximum period of 4 years. This is to replace Centro's existing framework that expires on 30th September 2015.

The framework will consist of 4 Lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Project Development and Delivery

Lot 2 - Transport Planning

Lot 3 - Project Management and Programme Management Office

Lot 4 - Market Research and Data Processing

Centro is proposing to qualify either 1, 3 or 4 consultants to each Lot of the framework and will usually undertake a suitable mini competition process to award each call-off.

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

Tenders are due back by the closing date of 12 noon on Monday 24th August 2015 and the deadline for clarification questions is 12 noon on Monday 17th August 2015.

Centro is holding a pre-tender Briefing Session for all interested bidders for this framework on Tuesday 14th July 2015 at Centro House, 16 Summer Lane, Birmingham, B19 3SD from 1100 - 1300. if this is of interest would you please confirm your attendance by 1200 on Monday 13th July 2015.

This Framework Agreement is available for any Local Authority, Integrated Transport Authority or public body in the U.K. to access and order from including specifically all seven West Midlands authorities (Birmingham City Council, Solihull, Coventry, Dudley, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Sandwell).

Some call-offs undertaken from this Framework Agreement may be subject to EU Involve / ERDF or other associated or relevant funding.

As this is a Framework Agreement it is not known at this stage what the aggregate value of spend will be across the various Lots over the duration of the framework in terms of Centro spend or spend incurred by the various organisations that can access and order directly from the framework. It is not the intention that Centro uses the framework to procure on behalf of other organisations rather that other public bodies have access to it and procure directly from the qualified suppliers for the Lot(s) concerned.

Please note that this is a one stage process where bidders will be asked to submit a PQQ at the same time as submitting their bid for the Lot(s) concerned (only 1 PQQ submission is required regardless of how many ITT's are being submitted). Only those responses that meet the minimum PQQ criteria will go on to have their tenders evaluated. 

All correspondence, submissions and communications in relation to this Framework Agreement should be conducted via BravoSolution, Centro's e-tendering portal (https://centro.bravosolution.co.uk). The references for Centro's PQQ and ITT documents in BravoSolution are as follows:

PQQ - pqq_57

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 12 months.  The total estimated value stated includes the option period.

As a Central Purchasing Body as defined by the EU Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU ('the Directive'), the Framework Agreement is open for use by Contracting Authorities (as defined by the Directive) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; or any Contracting Authority established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available on: https://www.espo.org/About-us-(1)/FAQs/Legal/How-does-ESPO-define-the-geographical-areas,-reffe

ESPO proposes to establish a commercial trading company whose target clients will be third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier will be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with that commercial trading company on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
The Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation. The company will enter into the framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other procurement legislation.
