The GEIC will house pilot production facilities and characterisation equipment. It will initially focus on a number of the University's world-class graphene application areas: energy, composites, formulations and coatings, electronics and membranes.
      
      Given the world leading graphene research at the University, it is expected that all equipment in the GEIC will be cited in high profile academic publications as well as underpinning industrial collaboration projects, thus giving the equipment a high degree of exposure. The GEIC will be situated on the North Campus of The University of Manchester, comprise of ~8400 m2 and has been designed by world-renowned architect Rafael Viñoly. It is set to be open in summer 2018. Equipment purchased before the GEIC building is opened will be temporarily commissioned elsewhere in the University campus, typically in the National Graphene Institute, and then moved into the GEIC once it is completed.

This tender is specifically for flexible gas and particulate analysis equipment. The longer term aim is development of a centre of excellence in emissions analysis research, which would enable a step-change in teaching experience and development of new taught modules inspired by the world-leading research in this globally significant area. This investment strategically aligns with growth areas across a number of key FSE Schools, and specifically with a new MACE strategic goal to better embed cutting-edge research within our teaching programmes.
      
      Air quality has been identified as one of the major public health issues facing the UK and is a critical issue in many urban areas globally, particularly in developing nations. Emissions from combustion engines are a significant factor in poor air quality. A significant research effort is required to establish fuel-mixes, combustion processes and engine technologies to minimise harmful emissions and to develop and implement emissions reduction strategies. The University of Manchester are uniquely placed to develop a centre of excellence in emissions analysis by drawing together expertise from Schools of MACE, CEAS and SEES. This will build upon our established expertise in Bio-energy including activities of the EPSRC Supergen Bioenergy hub (2015-2022) led from the School of MACE, Energy through the Manchester Energy Beacon, Environmental Science through the Manchester Environment Research Institute and thermodynamics expertise through MACE Aerodynamics and Thermofluids research groups.
      
      Development of a flexible emissions and performance measurement facility has benefit to research in both IC engines (diesel, gasoline and aviation gas turbines/jet) and other thermal energy processes such as wood stove emissions, developing world cookstove emissions and novel gasification processes. The equipment required would need to have flexibility to be used across all these processes. Purchase of a comprehensive gas and particulate analysis system will enable combustion mechanisms of a number of novel fuels to be investigated in order to establish how changes in fuel composition will affect the performance and emissions.
      
      The equipment chosen needs to be highly versatile and would support teaching and research in emissions from a range of processes, hence enabling development of a World Leading 'Centre of Excellence in emissions analysis'.

The Master's programme in Genomic Medicine was developed through collaboration between Health Education England (HEE) and Genomics England and in partnership with NHS England (NHSE). Since 2015 HEE have funded more than 550 Master's places at Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) commissioned to deliver the course for NHS staff in England. The core aim of the Master's programme framework is to train healthcare professionals from many different disciplines (e.g. medicine, nursing, scientists and technologists) for whom the knowledge from genomics will impact on their service delivery to patients.

The current delivery contract ends in September 2018. Due to the success of the programme, HEE is seeking a new contract with up to seven HEIs in England to deliver the Master's programme with the expectation that the final cohort of students will complete the course by September 2023. The contract will be for an initial three years with the possibility for a two year extension. The overall budget for the programme will be evenly distributed amongst the successful HEIs upon contract award with a maximum total financial envelope of £1 million per annum, with the exception of the final year where no student recruitment will take place. The final year of the contract will therefore have a £0 value. This distribution will be reviewed at the end of each academic year and can be adjusted based on provider performance.

ONR313,Contract,"HEALTH & SAFETY EXECUTIVE",Awarded,2016-12-22T08:52:39Z,"Provision of a research team to support ONR in the area of nuclear graphite structural integrity","The current contracts are due to end in September 2016 and ONR is seeking to put in place a new five year contract, to replace both of the existing contracts, for the provision of similar support services to those described above.  ONR envisages that the need for support will continue at about the present level.  However rather than offering a contract renewal on a single tender basis, ONR wishes to perform a 'market test' and will therefore conduct a tender exercise in which interested parties are invited to bid.

Although the current contracts are delivered through a Professor, a Lecturer, a PDRA and a consultant, it is important to note that ONR is prepared to consider other approaches to meeting the requirements and interested parties are invited to propose alternatives which will be assessed on a like for like basis against the other proposals received.  Reflecting the fact that the Professor and Lecturer have other University related duties, whereas the PDRA works entirely on ONR tasks, the main present contract does not require or expect the Professor and Lecturer to work on ONR projects full time.  You should therefore assume that the level of resource required to deliver the work needed under the new contract will be approximately equivalent to:
	(i) a PDRA working full time on ONR projects,
	(ii) both the Lecturer and Professor spending a quarter of their time on specifically ONR work.As described though, ONR generally expects much of the lecturer's and professor's other activities to be related to graphite technology.
	(iii) a professorial level consultant working approximately a quarter of his time.
	(iv) additional effort at any level can be added as an option.

The Contractor will be expected to produce annual plans and manage delivery of work programmes and projects  to agreed time, cost and quality standards as appropriate. 

Work programmes will be reviewed regularly and revised as appropriate in progress meetings held jointly by ONR and the Contractor.

In addition to working on programmes and projects agreed by ONR, the Contractor's staff would be expected to keep abreast of the current state of the graphite cores in AGRs, by attending meetings and considering documents as requested.  Throughout the contract advice is likely to be sought by ONR and this may necessitate the writing of reports etc. on a timely basis.

I.	The deep draw can body itself (inside and outside surfaces) and any surface treatment (e.g. aqua blasting) used to relieve stress.
II.	The closure weld and heat effected zone
III.	The bar code or any similar feature used to identify the can.
These areas can be characterised in a number of relatively simple ways:
a.	Crystallographic phases by x-ray diffraction (has the can manufacture introduced other phases which may influence the lifetime of the package )
b.	Surface finish/topography (sites to initiate corrosion)
c.	Microstructure by etching (grain size and orientation, inclusions) and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). The grain size of metal relates to a number of mechanical properties.
d.	Residual stress by x-ray diffraction (areas of high residual stress are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking)
e.	Hardness (resistance of metal to deformation)

The scope of metallurgical testing required is to investigate the 3 areas of interest identified above through characterisation techniques listed and conduct analysis of the results comparing to the existing THORP 3 in 1 SNM Package.",,,"Any region","71600000 ","Chris Williams",chris.z.williams@sellafieldsites.com,"Calder Bridge",,Seascale,"CA20 1PG",ENG,"+44 1925833316",http://www.sellafieldsites.com,,"https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=9643&B=SELLAFIELD https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/3510 ",,29/03/2017,31/12/2017,28/03/2017,NO,,No,No,No,Services,50000,70000,31/03/2017,55482,"[The University of Manchester|The University of Manchester

The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) is looking to select an organisation to manage the 2016-2020 round of the “Study China” study visit programme on behalf of the Department.  Proposals are therefore invited from organisations working in partnership with Chinese institutions wishing to run study visits in China for students (our definition: over 17 years of age and studying at or about to study at UK HEIs [including colleges]) from Easter 2017 until summer 2020.  It is envisaged that approximately 350 UK students per year will participate in “Study China” during this period.  The 3 week visit should be designed to give UK-based students with little or no knowledge of China or the Chinese language the opportunity to learn some Mandarin and experience Chinese culture and business links. It is hoped that the study visit experience will encourage the students to explore further opportunities for study or work in China.   
Although the programme is UK-wide, the BIS funding only covers students studying in English HEIs.  Additional places are also made available to the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, subject to funds being made available by the Devolved Administrations, they will make their own separate arrangements with the successful bidder.",,,London,"63000000 79997000 75121000 80000000 ","UK SBS Professional Services team",professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"UK Shared Business Services Ltd","North Star House",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,"Bidder Training.pdf PS16132 Contract terms.pdf AW5.2 PS16132 Price Schedule STUDY CHINA.pdf PS16132 RFP Request for Proposal questions.pdf Bidder - Logging into Emptoris for the first time.pdf PS16132 RFP Request for Proposal.pdf ",,"UK Shared Business Services eSourcing
