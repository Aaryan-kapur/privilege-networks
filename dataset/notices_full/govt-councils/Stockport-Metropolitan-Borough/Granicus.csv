"PRF 258",Contract,"PETERBOROUGH CITY COUNCIL",Awarded,2020-07-27T14:53:25Z,"ICT Granicus - Firmstep","The council has in place a number of forms packages that provide differing functionality to services and historically best fit has been used as a guide rather than overall strategic fit.

The council has been looking to find a strategic fit package for some time and has opted for Granicus Firmstep to fulfil that role. It is currently in use with Cambridgeshire County Council (CCC) and there are synergies in form usage across both authorities, particularly in the Social care areas. PCC plan to implement those forms on the new platform at the earliest opportunity. This will save both time and money as only a reskin will be required. There are some projects in place now that also require PCC to use Firmstep alongside CCC. They are: 

1. The reuse of forms in use by the Covid-19 Co-ordination Hub. They sit across both organisations and should be licenced as such.
2. The development of an interim Service Desk system for PCC using Firmstep.",,,"East of England","48000000 72000000 ","Tomi Egbo",Tomi.Egbo@peterborough.gov.uk,"Sand Martin House",,PETERBOROUGH,"PE2 8TY",England,07920160440,,,,,01/06/2020,31/05/2021,29/04/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,29325,,29/04/2020,29325,"[GRANICUS-FIRMSTEP LIMITED|15 Worship Street
