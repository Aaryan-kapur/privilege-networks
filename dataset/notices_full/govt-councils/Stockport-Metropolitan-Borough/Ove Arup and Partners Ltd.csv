This is in response to the Mayoral ambition of Liverpool being net zero carbon by 2030. Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCRCA) and Merseytravel have identified a need to stimulate a hydrogen economy within the Merseyside region. This begins with the generation of a supply and demand of and for Hydrogen Fuel. The first part of this journey is this FCEV bus procurement project.

Our high level objective for the project is to obtain data on the feasibility of hydrogen bus ownership. We anticipate this will inform an expansion of the zero carbon fleet and fleet management including Battery Electric Buses and provide insight to stimulate the expansion of Hydrogen refuelling facilities  across the  City Region. We aim to integrate this project with our climate resilience strategy for a cohesive approach to low emission transport. In addition, we will use the data to support further fleet opportunities for hydrogen . 

The Liverpool City Region has a hydrogen economy and our ambition is to support the development of that economy, promoting the expansion of jobs, skills and inclusive growth  with subsequent follow on projects in line with the LCRCA's emerging Hydrogen Strategy.

      A key component of the Commonwealth Games 2022 will be the redevelopment of Alexander Stadium site to meet all games requirements.
       
      The Stadium currently consists of 12,700 permanent seats housed in 4 stands. The Back Straight Stand built in 2012 with a capacity of 5,000 will remain for the Games period. The remaining 3 stands (Knowles, Main & Nelson) will be demolished and rebuilt for the Games.
      
      Design services for the development of Alexander Stadium to include the construction of a new stand (to replace the 3 above) will increase the permanent capacity post games to 20,000.  For the games period temporary structures will be put in place to create a 40,000 seat stadium for the opening, closing ceremonies and athletics event.
       
      In addition to the construction of a new stand, a 400m outdoor practice running track will be permanently housed at the High Performance Centre on site and will form part of the legacy of the Games.
      
      A design to complement the creation of a high quality aspirational neighbourhood in the heart of Perry Barr is required; to meet the venue brief provided by the Commonwealth Games Federation and to provide the very best legacy for the venue, allowing the facility to be sustainable for the future.

The key deliverables for this commission are:
1.	Development of a format for organising the information, tools and case studies to be included in the toolkit. The format should be suitable for a web-based location and compliant with any technical requirements of the HCA in this regard; engaging and easily navigable for users; potential to be interactive (e.g. including potential for an on-line forum, news area); capable of regular updating & accommodating new content by the HCA. The format should also allow content to be downloaded via PDF formats.
2.	Development of content for the toolkit to include an overview of / introduction to key themes / workstreams; development of tools to assist users in addressing key themes where appropriate; at least one case study relating to each of the garden communities currently part of the programme (also to include a generic framework for case studies that can be subsequently used by HCA to update the Toolkit). Content should not be reliant on excessive wordiness, but instead focus on alternative visual and other methods of communicating key messages and tools.
3.	Testing and feedback from potential users of the toolkit (to be agreed with HCA) to establish its usability and any completion of any refinements as a result.

Undertake an energy mapping and modelling study of the proposed area to identify potentially useful heating, cooling and power demand loads and potentially useful heat supply opportunities for the purposes of heat network scheme development .

Use the outputs of energy mapping to inform the development of an energy master plan for the proposed area which identifies, evaluates and prioritises any potential  heat network scheme opportunities. 

To assess local opportunities for deploying heat network, including sources of heat generation, and develop a strategy to create commercially and technical viable solutions in the boundary area including local residential opportunities. 

Priority should be given to study work and plan development on establishing a district heat network project for the area focusing on the Local Authority's own income generation within the master planning exercise. 

Consideration should also be given to the Local Authority owned or operated buildings within the study area to improve the tenants' energy security and resilience against rising energy prices.

ONR261,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS",Awarded,2015-11-17T10:48:43Z,"Provision of Support on Civil Engineering Safety Assessment for Step 3 of the UK ABWR","STATEMENT OF SERVICE REQUIREMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF SUPPORT ON CIVIL ENGINEERING SAFETY ASSESSMENT FOR STEP 3 OF GDA OF THE UK ABWR
BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT
1)	In January 2014 ONR formally started Step 2 of the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of Hitachi General Electric’s (Hitachi-GE) UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (UK ABWR). Hitachi-GE is the Requesting Party for the UK ABWR GDA (referred to as “the RP” in this specification).
2)	Step 2 of GDA is an overview of the acceptability, in accordance with the regulatory regime of Great Britain, of the design fundamentals, including review of key nuclear safety and nuclear security claims with the aim of identifying any fundamental safety or security shortfalls that could prevent the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) (see http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/ngn03.pdf for details). 
3)	During Step 2, ONR has reviewed the key safety claims put forward by RP in the area of Civil Engineering Preliminary Safety Report (PSR). ONR completed Step 2 at the end of August 2014. ONR’s technical assessment reports covering the assessment work undertaken during Step 2 and key conclusions were also published in August 2014.
4)	During Step 3, ONR will assess the “safety arguments” of the Civil Engineering safety case submissions which support the safety claims made.
5)	For Civil Engineering “safety argument” is interpreted as the structured robust justification to underpin the claims made by the RP (see also scope of the services required). The safety arguments should be coherent, sufficient and commensurate with the potential risks. They should provide the entry points and clear links to the safety case documentation as a whole. 
6)	ONR’s Step 3 assessment plan in the area of Civil Engineering acknowledged that the key claims on Civil Engineering by the RP during Step 2 were incomplete.  As a result, ONR’s Step 3 assessment will also consider whether the key claims relating to Civil Engineering that underpin the safety of the UK ABWR are complete and reasonable.
7)	For Civil Engineering “safety claim” is interpreted as being: 
	Specific and measurable statements that show that Civil Engineering aspects of the UK ABWR meet the relevant Safety Assessment Principles 2014.
	A clearly documented basis of design for each structure – to include classification, safety functional requirements, operational requirements, structural form, load paths, loads and combinations, materials and construction/decommissioning sequence. It should be noted that:
•	Safety claims and supporting documentation must have a clear structure and hierarchy so that the design basis is set out logically.
•	The UK context should be fully recognised and addressed
•	Internationally recognised standards and relevant good practice should be adopted
•	The codes and standards used for each structure should link to the classification of that structure.
