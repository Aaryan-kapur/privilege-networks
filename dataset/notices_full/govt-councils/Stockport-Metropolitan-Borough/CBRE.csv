Cornwall Council intends to establish a 4 year framework agreement with a maximum of 3 contractors.

The Mechanical & Engineering (M&E) requirement comprises 2 lots.
The Fabric requirement is tendered as 1 lot for which one contractor will be appointed.
A contractor may tender for all 3 lots.
The Framework will be let for an initial term of 2 years with the option to extend for a further year at the end of the second and third years of the frameworks operation (total duration including options would then be 4 years).
The purpose of this framework is to enable the Council and other permitted users to issue direct call-off contracts for the provision of engineering services and fabric maintenance works to a myriad of built assets. M&E services generally cover the mechanical and electrical statutory compliance, testing, planned and reactive maintenance to built assets whereas the fabric maintenance generally involves works to the structure and finishes of the built assets.
The successful contractor(s) will therefore need to have the capability, skills and expertise to carry out the services within a range of commercial, domestic and educational environments. The types and conditions of the built assets range from nearly new to dilapidated and consist mainly of corporate, school and domestic facilities such as offices, classrooms, etc. A more detailed list of buildings is provided within the ITT.
