The tender deadline has closed and evaluation of submitted tenders has been concluded no further offers are required.  The conract was divided into 2 Lots: 
Lot 1: Social Care Core IT System for Adults and Children Services 
Lot 2: Social Care Web Portal 
 Background 
  
The Authority has been a Northgate system user for approximately 16 years and uses most modules across adults and childrens case management along with financials. In addition to recording the social care activity across the two client groups the system is also making payments for foster carers and a range of externally commissioned providers (residential/nursing care, direct payments). We are also recording financial assessments for residential care electronically.  
  
However, the current system does not enable the Authority to record and monitor its contractual arrangements in a way which is fit for purpose and doesnâ€™t provide a platform which supports the level of integration, flexibility, usability and  mobilisation which the organisations digital strategy identifies.  As a result we have developed an ambitious roadmap to review and where necessary re-procure our core ICT systems to enable North Tyneside to truly deliver a transformational service.",,,"North East","72000000 ","Julie Gullon",julie.gullon@northtyneside.gov.uk,"Quadrant, Cobalt Business Park","The Silverlink North","North Tyneside","NE27 0BY",UK,"+44 1916435653",http://www.northtyneside.gov.uk/,,,,01/09/2016,30/08/2023,03/02/2016,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,1760000,,23/08/2016,1760000,"[Liquidlogic Limited|The Maidstone Studios, Vinters Business Park, New Cut Road, Maidstone, ME14 5NZ|||Yes|No]",,01/09/2016,30/08/2023,"Other ",
