      This is a joint procurement between the Northern Ambulance Alliance consisting of Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS), North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) and East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS). Whilst YAS and NWAS requirements are included in the Specification, a catalogue of core contractual items is being requested that can be applied to NEAS & EMAS if required. Both YAS and NWAS are undertaking the procurement directly and will progress jointly until the final recommendation at which point each organisation will follow their respective governance process that will lead to a potential award of Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, both NWAS and YAS will have separate contracts with the successful Supplier, with separate commencement dates.
