"2019/S 163-400951",Contract,"The Litmus Partnership Ltd",Awarded,2019-08-28T16:50:19Z,"The Laurus Trust - Tender for Cleaning Services","The successful Supplier will be required to provide cleaning services for The Laurus Trust at the following locations:

- Laurus Ryecroft,

- Laurus Cheadle Hulme,

- Cheadle Hulme Primary School,

- Didsbury High School,

- Cheadle Hulme High School.

The cleaning service provision to the Trust is a mixture of primary and secondary schools, including new builds and existing schools. To ensure that best value principles are applied the Governors and Senior Leaders of the Trust have decided to tender for the cleaning services.

A good quality and reliable cleaning service has a major effect on the whole learning environment for all our students, staff and visitors and this is why The Laurus Trust is insistent about maintaining a high quality learning environment for everyone by having exceptionally high cleaning standards.

When asked what would negatively impact their perception and learning experience, students often report the thought of unclean classrooms, dirty floors, spills or stains, dusty surfaces, poorly maintained and unclean toilets, hygiene rooms and dirty glass and windows. So a high quality cleaning service really matters.

It's essential to The Laurus Trust that the contractors bidding for this tender think broadly about all issues and not just the core cleaning service to compete and be successful in obtaining the contracts of the schools within the Trust.

We would like the contractors to always be on the lookout for new ways of doing things, coming up with new solutions for many common problems.

We need Contractors that will deliver service continuity, ensure standards are maintained and a contractor where the employees all take a high level of pride of their work, have ownership, are diligent, hardworking and always prepared to go the extra mile, be at work on time and turn up every day because they want to be part of our success, having a ""here today - here tomorrow"" approach, which in a large yet highly competitive market, it's these often-forgotten factors that can be the difference between the provision of a good and an excellent cleaning service.

Contractors are requested to ensure they consider all the aspects of service delivery and think carefully about the cleaning requirements needed to keep the buildings pristine.

The Laurus Trust wants to ensure the level of service currently provided is maintained and may be even enhanced. We need to be sure you can consistently deliver to our high expectations without excuses.

The Trust already knows that the successful provision of cleaning services is very much dependent on the development of a good working relationship between the Estates team of a facility and the contractor's supervisor and cleaning team on site. The Contractor is expected to use its best endeavours to cultivate such a relationship to benefit the smooth running of each establishment.
