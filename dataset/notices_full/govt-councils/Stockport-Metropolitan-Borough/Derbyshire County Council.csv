Derbyshire County Council is the authority responsible for local government in the County of Derbyshire (excluding Derby City).  The existing treasury management consultancy contract expires on 31 July 2016, and the authority is seeking to procure an effective service to commence on 1 August 2016.

The contract will be for a period of up to four years (3 years + 1 year) subject to funding, service performance and the needs of the Council.
 
The authority wishes to appoint a Single Service Provider to deliver the requirements.

The contract is primarily to provide the Council with advice in respect of treasury management matters.  The role will include the provision of advice in respect of economics; the Council’s borrowing and temporary investment activity; government regulations on related topics; the CIPFA Code of Practice on Treasury Management, DCLG Guidance on Local Authority Investments, capital accounting and balance sheet issues and other related topics.

Derbyshire County Councils requires a minimum standard of over three years’ extensive experience in providing Treasury Management Advice and Consultancy to local authorities or an organisation of a similar size to Derbyshire County Council.
Derbyshire County Council currently manages the Treasury Management operations of the 
Derbyshire Pension Fund and the D2N2 LEP Growth Fund. 

A Combined Authority of councils in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire has been formed to
discuss options for mutual collaboration and working together. It is possible that 
additional Local Authority bodies may come under Derbyshire County Council’s Treasury
Management umbrella during the term of the contract. If this event occurs, then agreement
with regard to pricing revision will be based on the information provided in the tender 
submission.  Similarly Derbyshire County Council’s Treasury Management could be 
amalgamated under a Combined Authority Treasury Management. 

The purpose of seeking a single expert supplier in this field and utilising their experience and 
capability is to ensure the Council is spending their budget most effectively to achieve the 
desired outcomes it would not be able to gain alone in-house.  The supplier must 
therefore consistently evidence and deliver best value consultancy, showing its worth by 
considering and providing the right combination of price and quality.      


Immediately from award of contract, the supplier must be available to work with the Council to
carry out the service.  Upon expiry of the contract the provider must provide reasonable 
assistance to the Council, should the service transfer to another provider.

The annual budget for this service is between £12,000 and £20,000.  Bids exceeding this range will be deemed non-compliant.",,,"East Midlands","66600000 ","Nicola Wood",nicola.wood2@derbyshire.gov.uk,"Derbyshire County Council",,Matlock,"DE4 3AG",UK,"+44 1629536285",http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=a072a6cf-05db-e511-810e-000c29c9ba21 ",,01/08/2016,31/07/2020,16/03/2016,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,48000,80000,28/06/2016,67000,"[Arlingclose Ltd,|60 Moorgate,

In the interests of offering a seamless service the two authorities share the Library Management System and Schools Library Service. 

Inspire is the brand name of Culture, Learning, Libraries (Midlands), a Community Benefit Society providing library services and the wider cultural offer on behalf of Nottinghamshire County Council. Nottinghamshire County Council continues to provide funding under contract between NCC and Inspire. As such, Inspire retains access to certain services including Procurement through NCC. The day to day management of the book supply contract is the responsibility of Inspire, but the maintained value of expenditure on stock acquisitions is specified in the contract between Inspire and the Council.

Inspire and Nottingham City libraries have had a similar working relationship following local government reorganisation, and the two authorities share the Library Management System.  Nottinghamshire Education Library Service (= ELS) shares the same LMS as the two public authorities, and is an existing part of the same book supply contracts.

This contract will be initially awarded to up to three suppliers, (one for each lot) for 2 years with the possible extension up to a maximum of 2 years (2 x 1 year extension).

The Council is looking to secure the services of an enthusiastic provider to create and deliver an innovative provision across three phases and take responsibility for working effectively with other stakeholders. The Council is prepared to consider a partnership bid to deliver each phase of the service.

The research element (Phase 1) will be undertaken over the first 6 months by examining international and national research but primarily conducting local research on adults' awareness of, attitudes towards and behaviours around falls and falls prevention. This would ideally include methods designed to identify population groups most at risk of falling in Derbyshire, qualitative research, and a review of the current provision of falls prevention services provided across the county.

Research will secure an evidence base to identify the awareness of, attitudes towards and behaviours around falls and falls prevention across:

•	The diverse communities of Derbyshire
•	Different age groups e.g. those who have fallen (65+), those at risk (65+), those affected i.e. carer's (all ages), those approaching older age (50-64)
•	Different genders
•	Different socio-economic groups
•	Specific targeted localities

The research in Phase 1 will determine the design of the social marketing campaigns, target cohorts and precise messages (Phase 2 & 3) which will be directed at all those at risk of or affected by falls. The provider will also be required to work with existing services delivering falls prevention interventions to ensure messages are tested and incorporated into current practice.  

Social marketing messages will be designed to achieve what works best, with whom and how it is best delivered for the specific targeted group, in order to create the greatest impact on awareness of, attitudes towards and behaviours around falls and falls prevention. These messages will need to be age-friendly and delivered via the correct mediums informed by the Phase 1 research.

These modifications are made under the provisions set out in Regulation 72 (1) (c) (i), (ii) and (iii). Central Government Treasury Procurement Policy Note - Responding to COVID-19 PPN 01/20 (pp 6-7) also refers. The need for contract modification has been brought about by the circumstances of COVID-19 which have meant resources in the contracting authority have been redirected to efforts to support frontline Health and Social Care activities, including direct care for service users and efforts to support supply chain activities. The supply markets have also become unstable and unlikely to respond in many instances to the authorities procurement requirements at this time with the government furlough scheme. As a result, existing arrangements for certain contracts have been extended for a flexible period of between 6 and a maximum of 12 months, terminable on a monthly basis, while the current circumstances are present. This will ensure statutory requirements for the authority are maintained and disruption to normal business activities is kept to a minimum. The scale of the impact of COVID-19 and the uncertain duration could not have been foreseen by the contracting authority.Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the majority of new procurements have been temporally postponed to ensure that the authority remains transparent in the way new procurements are tendered. Following external legal advice on the lack of personnel resource in many businesses across the country, and therefore the likely inability to complete professional tender submissions, DCC has taken the view that the progression of current active out to market procurements should be viewed on an individual basis & in certain cases postponed.

The Study will provide an evidence based approach to future development, identifying what actions need to be taken in order to create sustainable growth.
The current proposition, as outlined within Appendix 2, is for illustrative purposes only, and the study will need to:
•	present the geographic scope of the development of the Hub, assessing how points of interest link spatially across the area, and explain how these contribute to the development of an alternative, sustainable short-break destination.
•	analyse the current offer and the potential for increased demand, presenting models of future growth with an assessment of uplift and an analysis of market capacity and competition. This should include a review of current accommodation and other facilities such as cafés and bike hire etc. that can attract the fun-family and active adult markets. And should suggest (and market test) the optimal range of activities as part of the development of the economic rationale that will underpin any future investment decisions.
•	test the economics of developing a sustainable tourism hub, by considering alternative economic models such as 'not-for-profit', 'willingness to pay' and 'voluntourism', alongside a more traditional economic model. Consideration should be given to: developing 'circular' and 'local' economies; promoting local products; zero-carbon or low-carbon development; using any development to support health and wellbeing; and to make a positive contribution to local cultural and environmental heritage by directing profits into future management. This work should be carried out with consideration for price-point, in order to develop the Hub as an affordable and sustainable alternative destination.

The L-shaped range forms part of a core group of other historic buildings at the Country Park, including the adjacent country house (Elvaston Castle) which is a Grade II*. There are also many other built structures within the garden which are Grade II listed.
The need for the repairs and refurbishment work has arisen to address the poor and worsening condition of the fabric, in particular the roofs. 
These repairs, once complete, will bring the building up to a standard that will potentially allow conversion works to facilitate occupation by commercial tenants in turn helping to contribute towards the future sustainability of the estate. A major funding bid is envisaged (in 2019) to finance the creation of a Visitor Hub within the core buildings area of Elvaston Castle Country Park and it is hoped that the future conversion of this building will form part of this project.",,,"East Midlands","45000000 ","Stuart Etchells",stuart.etchells@derbyshire.gov.uk,"Derbyshire County Council",,Matlock,"DE4 3AG","United Kingdom","+44 1629538204",http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=ac3efa5f-5dee-e811-80ef-005056b64545 ",,29/04/2019,28/02/2020,29/01/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Works,700000,700000,21/06/2019,864911,"[Messenger Construction Ltd|Unit 18B Cobbett Road Zone 1 Business Park Burntwood Staffordshire  WS7 3GL.|NONE||No|No]","Ian Bird",01/07/2019,01/04/2020,"Open ",

Evidence suggests that engaging and involving patients in the planning, design and delivery of health and social care support and service provision can lead to more joined-up, co-ordinated and efficient services that are responsive to local community needs.

The key aims and objectives identified by the Commissioners will include; • Develop a sustainable model of engagement that provides value for money, is fully inclusive and provides a wide range of opportunities for service receiver and carer involvement in the commissioning process and improvements in service delivery • Develop an improved mechanism for the views of patients to be fed into service delivery, development and review • Ensure a consistent approach to engagement across geographical localities and across all communities • Maximise opportunities for engagement of seldom heard voices and ensure inclusivity of REGARDS characteristics. Engagement must also cover a wide range of mental health issues • Actively promote opportunities for engagement and involvement in localities and across all communities using a variety of means and methods, reaching groups both with and without a primary focus of mental health (where people affected by mental health problems may be represented • Support the development of and enable engagement from a wide range of organisations, communities and individuals across Derbyshire and Derby City • Co-ordinate and support communication between commissioners, providers, organisations, communities and individuals with an interest in engagement around mental health.

TD1188/2,Contract,"Derby City Council",Awarded,2017-07-06T09:25:51Z,"Request for Proposals for White Label Energy Agreement","Derby City Council (DCC) has taken the decision to offer a trusted local authority energy brand to its citizens as an alternative. DCC is seeking bids from OFGEM licensed energy providers that can deliver a white label gas and electricity product.

In December 2016 DCC and Derbyshire County Council conducted soft market testing to assess the viability of forming a white label arrangement with licensed energy providers. The soft market testing has helped us as an organisation clarify what is possible and how it aligns to our corporate goals. We have also taken the view that we will work independently, and not in conjunction with the County Council; however, we will explore possibilities for marketing in non-City areas in the future.

As part of this exercise, we are inviting companies to state how they will meet our vision and then propose draft terms and conditions for a white label arrangement.

This will take place using the East Mids Tenders e-tendering portal and you will need to register your company details at https://www.eastmidstenders.org.  Registration is a quick and easy process done by going to the website and clicking on the 'REGISTER' link at the top of the page. Further details of the exercise, including how to respond, are available on the portal (Project ID: DN234632).

Please note: organisations wishing to take part must express an interest by 12:00 on Thursday 2nd February. It is recommended you express and interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit your response. The deadline for responses is 14:00 on Friday 3rd February 2017.",,,"East Midlands","09000000 ","James West",procurement@derby.gov.uk,"Council House","Corporation Street",Derby,"DE1 2FS",England,01332-640768,,,"https://www.eastmidstenders.org ",,20/02/2017,19/02/2022,03/02/2017,YES,TD1188,Yes,Yes,No,NotSpecified,0,,13/06/2017,0,"[Robin Hood Energy Limited|Robin Hood Energy Limited
