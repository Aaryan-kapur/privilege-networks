STOCK001-DN361496-91535974,Contract,"Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council",Awarded,2018-10-17T17:22:03Z,"Remote Enforcement","Parking on school 'keep clear' markings can seriously jeopardise road safety for children and it is the source of a significant number of complaints and demands for parking enforcement. Traditional enforcement using Civil Enforcement Officers (CEO) on foot can be ineffective and inefficient because schools are often in residential areas and may present a parking problem only for a short period of time twice a day. CEOs visit all schools in Stockport twice per term (six times per year) as a minimum. Stockport has 84 Primary Schools, 13 Secondary Schools and 6 Special Schools. Consequently it is difficult to effectively cover the sites but there have also been occasions when the sudden presence of an officer has led to inappropriate driving manoeuvres from drivers eager to escape the possibility of receiving a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). Additional motorists comply, but only whist it is evident the CEO's are on site. Alternative methods of enforcement have therefore been considered. The Traffic Management Act 2004 specifically allows for camera enforcement where traditional CEO enforcement is difficult, sensitive or simply not practical. It is recognised that camera enforcement of this dangerous but short-term practice of parking whilst dropping off children on school zig-zag markings is the only really efficient and effective means of control. The Deregulation Act also allows for CCTV to be used to enforce bus stop/stand clearways and bus lanes. Stockport has specific locations where such enforcement would be of value to assist with highway safety and the efficient operation of bus services. In particular it is envisaged that the Council could use CCTV enforcement of parking on bus stop clearways at some locations close to shops and educational establishments where such parking can be a problem for bus operations. The Council could also use CCTV enforcement of the Warren Street and former A6 'Simpson's Corner' busways where traffic cutting through, sometimes at speed, risks pedestrian and cycle safety.",,,"North West","34000000 ","Paul Atherton",paul.atherton@star-procurement.gov.uk,"Trafford Council","Trafford Town Hall, Talbot Road",Stretford,"M32 0TH",England,"+44 7976957806",http://www.stockport.gov.uk/,,,,08/10/2018,07/10/2019,17/09/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,128000,128000,17/10/2018,106299,"[NSL Ltd|B3 2JR|NONE||No|No]","Mr Nigel Pinnock",22/10/2018,21/04/2020,"Open ",
