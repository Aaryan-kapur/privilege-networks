Experts by experience are people who have personal experience of the services we regulate, either directly or as carers.
During inspections, experts by experience speak with people using services and their family or organisations that support them. They may also watch how the service is delivered and speak to staff. Their findings are used to support inspectors' judgements on services and may be included in inspection reports.
We want experts by experience to provide three types of support:
- inspection - support to site visits and telephone calls,
- monitor and insight - support gathering local and national information from the public. This will include special reviews and investigations as well as work raising public awareness of CQC,
- co-production - support to policy and guidance development and delivery of CQC staff training.
To aid CQC in developing its ways of working, the day-to-day activities of ExE will be managed by an external organisation on CQC's behalf, which will involve the co-ordination and arrangement of activities.

CQC is seeking to utilise the Restricted Procedure (as defined in Regulation 28 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015) and also employing the provisions of the Light Touch Regime (LTR) as detailed in Regulations 74 to 76 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015.
In accordance with Regulation 28 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015, only those economic operators who have passed an initial, qualitative, selection criteria will be invited to tender to provide the service by CQC.

During the life of the Contract including any period(s) of extension(s), CQC reserves the right to modify the Services as described in this Statement of Requirements, Core Services A and Additional Services B relying on Regulation 72 (1)(a) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, without a new procurement irrespective of the monetary value of the modification.

Northamptonshire County Council is running a simultaneous procurement process that will result in the successful provider(s) holding one or two contracts; one a statutory advocacy service and the other a specialist Mental Capacity Act including DoLS advocacy service. 

Northamptonshire County Council are:
- seeking an outstanding independent advocacy service that will prioritise statutory advocacy ensuring Northamptonshire's adults have a strong voice that is heard and is at the heart of assessment, care planning, safeguarding and review processes in social care, community care and general and mental health services.
- looking for an advocacy service that responds to the requirements of a number of legislative Acts, notably the Care Act 2014. Also, it must deliver an advocacy service that promotes individual wellbeing and prevention, supports the transition into adult care, can intervene earlier, prevent needs escalating and manage demand.
- wanting to create an integrated advocacy service that assists specific service user groups that include young people transitioning to adulthood, adults, older people and patients in their involvement during a safeguarding enquiry, needs or carer's assessment, care and support plan or support plan, and review processes. This integrated and seamless service will enable adult users to easily find, access and navigate the right services at the right time and to take control of their support arrangements. 

The service will be required from 1st August 2017 for an initial period of 3 years (up to 31st July 2020) with an option to extend for a further period of up to 2 years, taking the total contract term to a maximum of 5 years. Any extension will be agreed between the Council and the provider(s). The Authority believes that TUPE does apply to this contract at its commencement. 

The detailed requirements are defined in the Specification. The deadline for completed ITTs to be received on the LGSS eTendering Portal is 12:00noon on Tuesday 9th May 2017.",,,"East Midlands","85000000 ","Amy Myers",ammyers@northamptonshire.gov.uk,"John Dryden House","8-10 The Lakes",Northampton,"NN4 7YD",England,,http://www.lgssprocurementportal.co.uk,,,,01/08/2017,31/07/2020,09/05/2017,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,2265230,2265230,20/06/2017,393240,"[VoiceAbility|Mount Pleasant House, Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, CB3 0RN|||No|Yes]",,01/08/2017,01/08/2020,"Open ",
DORST001-DN341953-53719385,Contract,"Dorset County Council",Awarded,2020-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Alternative Provision Framework for Children and Young People","Dorset County Council, Bournemouth Borough Council and Borough of Poole are expanding the information we provide on alternative provision by establishing an Alternative Provision Framework. This is a competitive process in order to establish a Framework of value for money, quality assured Providers. The aim is that there will be a variety of Alternative Provision programmes/activities/services supporting children and young people which can be accessed by Bournemouth Borough Council, Dorset County Council, the Borough of Poole and all Schools (including specialist schools and academies). During the planning of this Framework the project group have developed a competitive process for organisations who provide alternative provision services to children and young people, to be added to a quality assured Framework in order that they can deliver their services throughout the county of Dorset, including Bournemouth and Poole. To comply with procurement regulations tenders will be invited for services within the main service categories, which are: * Engagement & Reengagement * Therapeutic * Counselling * Vocational Provision & Employability * Teaching To ensure that a range of Alternative Provision services are made available across the County that can meet the diverse range of needs and circumstances of children and young people, this tender is to establish a Framework of Alternative Provision providers across a range of services. It is our intention that the Framework will run from September 2018 to September 2022. The Framework is designated as a 'Rolling Flexible Framework' which is using the functionality of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) procedure and has been adapted under the Light Touch Regime. As soon as the competitive process closes then the next round will open. This will allow new providers to join the Framework and allow existing providers to change the services that they offer throughout the Framework period. This will ensure that children and young people continue to benefit from new opportunities, from the entry of new providers and have an evolving and wide range of choices/support to meet their needs. The intention is that the Framework will develop and change as required. Existing Framework members will remain on the Framework until it expires, they leave or are removed under the provisions of their individual Framework agreement and they will not need to re-join each year. The Framework will re-open and submissions will be evaluated on a 4-monthly basis. The indicative spend for Dorset County Council is £499,525 per annum. Historically there has been a Dorset County Council contract in place for mentoring valued from £97,900 - £139,008. This indicative spend for Bournemouth Borough Council is £424,869 per annum and the Borough of Poole indicative spend is £197,282 per annum. This Tender is being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union.",,,"South West","80100000 80200000 80340000 80420000 80590000 80310000 80570000 80513000 ","Greg Jackson",g.a.jackson@dorsetcc.gov.uk,"Dorset County Council","County Hall",Dorchester,"DT1 1XJ",England,"+44 1305221657",http://www.dorsetforyou.com/,,,,18/09/2018,17/09/2022,20/07/2018,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,5000000,5000000,10/09/2018,5000000,"[Dorset Trade Skills (SW) Limited|Unit A6
