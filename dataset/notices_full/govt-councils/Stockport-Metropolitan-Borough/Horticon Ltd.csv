All items must have a minimum gurantee of 15 Years.

Requirements

Overflow car parking at Buckley Hill Playing Fields
Overflow car parking is required at the above site to maximise the number of private light vehicles/ cars able to park on site during peak times of football play at the weekened. The site is not heavily used during the week.

The layout of the overflow should be broadly in line with the attached outline plan (which was used to seek Planning Permission). The overflow should accommodate circa 135 additional spaces measuring 2.4x4.8M, with 6m between rows to allow suitable access and turning circles etc. 6Nr larger disabled bays should be allowed for within the design (location to be agreed)

-	Install circa 64 parking spaces to the right of the main entrance. The area is predominately even and flat and has well established grass growth across most of the area.  There are some gentle undulations on site but these ar not deemed a concern.  
 
-	Create circa 109 parking spaces in the second area as show on the plan (circa 74 being grass reinforced mesh, the remainder being marking out of the tarmac surfacing. This area needs work to get ground ready for the mesh surfacing to perform well.  This includes clearing,  perhaps installing a drainage layer, topping with sandy soils to an 200mm depth and turfed with an amenity grass.  Most of this second area to the left is currently in the same good condition as the area to the right.


The material for extended surfacing should be a heavy mesh style plastic reinforment, such as SureGreen GR14 or similar approved. 

Car parking spaces markers should also be included. An existing area of hard standing shall also be marked out to formalise parking at this area too.

Works are to include for all preliminary ground works to level surface areas, lay the material, and establish grass sward to four full cuts. Protective fencing shall be required to protect the existing hedging on Buckley Hill, and to prevent access to the working area of construction, both during construction, and through the establishment period.

Consideration shall also be given to the junction between the grass matting overflow and the existing hard surfaced areas.
