INTEXTWOR2016,Contract,"WESTWORKS PROCUREMENT LIMITED",Awarded,2016-05-18T10:17:42Z,"Internal & External Works 2016","Initial expressions of interest are invited from potential providers wishing to provide planned, cyclical and ad hoc external works services to occupied & vacant domestic housing & commercial properties throughout the area covered by Westworks, its members and partners. Providers appointed to the framework may be required to act as main contractor within projects and to utilise supply chains already or yet to be established by Westworks. Similarly providers may be required to act as a supply partner to users partnerships. These occurrences will be clearly indicated to potential providers at the time of contract call off by users and will be incorporated as part of the mini competition process.

The geographical area to be covered by this framework covers the South and South west of England. For an approximate distribution of the volume of works required please review the information in the suite of download documents.
We are therefore inviting variant bids based on GEOGRAPHICAL capability so as to encourage small to medium and larger enterprises to participate. Companies should make clear the areas within which they can presently deliver the services required. Limited geographical coverage by a potential provider will not necessarily exclude them from the process as it is Westworks members aim to encourage local employment and businesses as well as engaging with other suitably qualified providers. It is the intention of Westworks to engage with enough suitably qualified providers to achieve these aims. 

The TOTAL estimated value is between £1 million to £850 million over the entire 4 year life of the framework. 

The framework will be of 13 work stream lots and multiple providers will be considered to achieve geographical and volume coverage for each lot:

1. Kitchen Instalations
2. Bathroom Instalations
3. Electrical Instalations
4. Electrical Testing and Remedial Works
5. Gas Heating Instalations
6. Window Instalations
7. Door Instatlations
8. Groundworks
9. Damp Proofing
10. General Building
11. Flat Roofing
12. Piched Roofing
13. Cavity Wall Insulation Cleaning and Reinstatement

IMPORTANT note:

It is not the intention to split the works by geographical lots but to award places on the framework based on having enough providers to deliver in all areas and to award works contracts by running mini-competitions (mini-tenders) from the framework. Bidders will be required to identify the areas in which they are able to provide the services described within the tender documents.",,,"Any region,East Midlands,West Midlands,London,South East,South West,Wales","92522000 45000000 ","Susana Almeida",info@westworks.org.uk,"The National Self Build & Renovation Centre, Lydiard Fields,","Great Western Way",Swindon,"SN5 8UB",England,,www.westworks.org.uk,,,,09/09/2016,08/09/2020,05/07/2016,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,1000000,850000000,08/11/2016,1000000,"[24-7 Home Serve Ltd|Unit 23, 35 High Street
