Islington Council is undertaking a programme of recycling site improvements that involve making estate and public recycling sites more aesthetically pleasing, reducing contamination and fly-tipping and increasing the level of recycling. This will be done, in part, through the installation of housing units at selected recycling sites in Islington. We wish to install up to 200 enclosures at a number of recycling sites around the Borough. We will be targeting high profile public sites, estate sites that have experienced problems with fly tipping, and other sites where local stakeholders have identified local priority sites for improvement. The sites will be in a variety of locations. We anticipate up to 200 individual units being installed at approximately 50 sites. Due to the varied nature of Islington Council it is likely that different styles of housing units with different designs and finishes will be selected at different locations. It is anticipated that a variety of enclosures options and finishes may be offered and each will be evaluated individually for inclusion in a call off order, to be called off depending on the needs and context of each individual recycling site.",,,London,"34928480 ","Strategic Procurement",Procurement@islington.gov.uk,"7 Newington Barrow Way",,London,"N7 7EP",England,"+44 2075278118",http://www.islington.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert/Index?advertId=a704f370-9c68-e711-80e3-005056b64545 ",,01/09/2017,01/03/2019,18/08/2017,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,0,300000,07/09/2017,300000,"[Affresol Ltd|Unit 2, Queensway
