All possible strategies must be utilised to enable patients to return to their usual place of residence both prior to transfer from ESHT acute hospitals and throughout their stay with the NWB rehabilitation service.  Following review and amendment of weight-bearing status at orthopaedic out-patient clinic, a review of the patient must be undertaken by the NWB Therapy Team to ascertain whether return home or transfer to rehabilitation bed is the best course.  For clarity, the requirement is for x24 beds to be available for the provision of the service 365(6) days of the year, therefore it is expected that there may be periods when beds are unoccupied and available for new patients.  Upon vacation, beds must be available for re-occupation within 24 hours.  The NWB status may apply to either lower or upper limb.

Many care home residents live with long term multiple health problems and also have ""end of life"" needs requiring holistic care planning and delivery by skilled and experienced staff. 

This specification is intended to outline the expected outcomes the CCG wants to see for individuals in nursing homes in receipt of NHS Healthcare funding. 

Its contents provide an overview of what we would expect to see delivered in order that service users are provided for and supported to lead as fulfilling and holistic life as possible, and to die with dignity and respect. 

This specification does not substitute for a service user's care plan as it would be expected their care plan will be one which is individualised and tailored to meet their changing care needs, and should be considered in conjunction with this specification.

Objectives:

•	To provide high quality care through experienced, competent, supported and trained workforce. 
•	To improve the service users' health and wellbeing and ensure their safety thus reducing hospital admission. 
•	To have care needs met in a way that puts the service user at the centre. 
•	To provide good quality care that meets the required and expected standards of Nursing Home providers.
•	To provide a clean safe environment for service users. 
•	To provide a calm and stable environment for service users.
•	To establish effective links with and work in close collaboration with other Health and Social Care Services to support service users' care.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","85100000 ","Brenda Powell",Brenda.Powell@greaterhuddersfieldccg.nhs.uk,"White Rose House","West Parade",Wakefield,WF11LT,England,0148464262,www.wakefieldccg.nhs.uk,,"www.NHSSourcing.co.uk ","It is anticipated that this tender will open on the 17 October 2019.
