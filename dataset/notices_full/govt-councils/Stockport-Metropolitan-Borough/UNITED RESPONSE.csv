Derby City Council is therefore tendering for a Younger Adults Domiciliary Care Services framework for people with complex needs to be delivered in their own homes from November 2017 This will replace an existing Dynamic Purchasing Service Agreement.

The Framework will provide support for younger adults with complex needs, those with a learning disability and / or autism, and with mental health difficulties.  Many will have, at times, behaviours that are considered to be ""challenging"", and providers will be required to demonstrate how they can minimise its impact by developing positive work with individuals.

The Council wishes to commission services that improve Customers' wellbeing or quality of life where the quality of the service is measured by the improvement in quality of life outcomes.  An enablement approach lies at the heart of the services we wish to procure for Domiciliary Care and providers will be assessed for their success in this area.

This outcomes based approach will necessitate a change in the relationship between Customers, Providers and Commissioners as it requires a greater focus upon person-centred working and the adoption of outcomes based purchasing, provision and monitoring of services.

Outcome based service provision requires the following:

•	Each Customer will have their personal Customer Outcomes which are to be met by the service agreed.  The views of their carer or representative if appropriate will be taken into consideration and will form part of this Agreement.
•	The Authority will then specify the Customer Outcomes to be met by The Service Provider
•	The Service Provider, in consultation with social care leads, will agree with each Customer how and when they will be supported to achieve their Outcomes.

Please note suppliers wishing to express interest and obtain the documentation must do so by 17:00 on 24th September 2017. It is recommended that you express interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit a bid. 

The deadline for returns is 10:00 on 25th September 2017. 

Please visit the Council's e-tendering system at www.eastmidstenders.org, where you can express interest and obtain the documents.

Due to the estimated discharges in the next 12 months within the Pan-Lancashire area, a Flexible Agreement has been developed. This is intended to be an interim agreement and will initially be in place for one year with the option to extend for up to a further three years if required.  This is to allow the time to develop further commissioning options for Transforming Care whilst allowing us to have an initial agreement in operation as early as October 2016, to allow Transforming Care placements to be commissioned with suitably selected providers via this Flexible Agreement.
Social value has been considered throughout the development of the service specification and is part of the evaluation methodology.
Please note that the original RFQ in relation to this tender has been amended due to a revision to the selection criteria in relation to CQC ratings.

LCC requires a Provider to be registered with CQC for the regulated activity of Personal Care by the tender deadline of the 12th August 2016 however if a Provider nominates an office that is currently unrated as it has not yet been inspected by CQC then your Submission will not be disregarded on that basis, however at the point when the office has its first inspection you must inform the lead officer immediately and your nominated office must meet the requirements of either outstanding, good or requires improvement (latter with robust justification). Prior to contract award where the status of your nominated office does not meet the requirements for the Flexible Agreement your Submission will be disregarded. Following contract award if any provider is given an overall rating of requires improvement or inadequate for the nominated office the Contracting Body reserves the right to suspend/terminate the agreement depending on its own judgement.  

The RFQ on the e-tendering system has been amended to reflect this along with all the tender documents. The tender deadline will be extended to the 12/08/16 to allow providers sufficient time to consider submitting a bid having taken into account the revised criteria.",,,"North West","85000000 ","Joanne Sherborne",joanne.sherborne@lancashire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor, Christ Church Precinct","County Hall",Preston,"PR1 8XJ",England,"01772 531427",,,"http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/?siteid=6864&pageid=41137&e=e ","Please Note:  Value of Contract
