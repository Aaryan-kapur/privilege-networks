The objectives are to deliver a skate park facility which is designed and constructed to the highest possible standard, in concrete, led by a specialist skate park constructor with a strong record of accomplishment in user-responsive design, considerate construction, after-care and support for subsequent activation of the space, and the design should be responsive to the Key Design Principles listed in the tender documentation, as well as national and international best-practice, and should be accessible for a broad range of abilities and ages with potential for progression. The facility should be a concrete freeform skate park that is designed for a range of wheeled sports and different abilities.
