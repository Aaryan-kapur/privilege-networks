The Contract term will be 12 months (1st April 2020 to 31st March 2021), with the option to extend the contract for 12 months (1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022) at the sole discretion of the Commissioners.
NHS Castle Point and Rochford Clinical Commissioning Group on behalf of MSE STP secured funding to enable circa 50 priority GP Practices sites to fully digitalise their LG wallets. This procurement related to Phase 1 of the programme requiring the provision of the service for an estimated 578,632 LG wallets across circa 50 GP Practices, by no later than 31st March 2021.
If funding becomes available there may be the potential to roll out the digitisation of LG wallets to other GP Practices within the MSE STP footprint, however at this stage, funding has only been secured for Phase 1 (circa 50 prioritised Primary Care sites).
The estimated potential aggregate contract value over the contract term (1 year + 1 year extension) is £4,338,246 GBP. This figure encompasses the Actual Available Budget for Phase 1, in addition to any anticipated future phases being implemented during the first year and or subsequent extension period, should such 12-month extension be activated by commissioners. The Actual Available Budget for Phase 1, which acted as an affordability envelope for this procurement for the purposes of bidding (not including any extension period) was (net of VAT) £1,537,887 GBP. 
Any subsequent Phase(s) (and prices associated with such Phase(s)), will be mutually agreed between Provider and Commissioner using prices submitted for Phase 1 via appropriate Contract Variation mechanisms. It's anticipated that any subsequent Phase(s) will cover outstanding LG Wallets (indicatively 1,024,615) across remaining GP Practices in the MSE STP. The additional contract value communicated in the Contract Notice (£2,800,358 GBP) that is over and above the Actual Available Budget (£1,537,887 GBP), is indicative and provided solely for purposes of future proofing this contract, should the Commissioner secure additional funding to implement subsequent Phase(s). Commissioners may wish to and as such reserve the right to expand services during the lifetime of the contract potentially resulting in subsequent Phases of delivery then that set out in the specification at the time of contract award. As such, the Contracting Authority made it clear in Contract Notices that Bidders should be aware that after the award of contract, there is a possibility that the successful Bidder may be offered a contract variation in accordance with Regulation 72(1)(a) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, to include an indicative number of additional wallets.",,,"East of England","79999100 ","NHS Castle Point & Rochford Clinical Commissioning Group",amy.wilson@attain.co.uk,"Pearl House, 12 Castle Road",,Rayleigh,"SS6 7QF",England,,https://castlepointandrochfordccg.nhs.uk,,,"

The system is required to support the overall aim of moving from an enforcement driven tenancy management model by adopting a new approach to tenancy management based on a 'healthy tenancy' outcome, driven by an agreed model of support and self-management, underpinned by an integrated data management system. A major driver for replacing the existing Capita Housing Management (Academy) system is that the supplier has confirmed this will be officially de-supported at the end of August 2020. The Council's aim is to have the replacement fully implemented and working as a like-for-like replacement by 1st July 2020. The successful supplier will be expected to demonstrate that they can achieve this target.

NHS Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group is responsible for planning and commissioning health services for over 1.3 million people living in Birmingham and Solihull.

NHS Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group supports 217 GP sites made up of 169 main GP Practices and 49 branches dotted across the estate. Each GP Practice site sits within a federation with patient population varying from 2000 to 70,000.

Paper records are over 70 years old in a state of deterioration therefore becoming illegible coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The security and accuracy of these records is vital and needs to be preserved.

Birmingham has one the youngest populations in the England, a more ethnically diverse background and higher than average level of deprivation compared to the rest of England. In comparison, Solihull is a broadly affluent borough in both the regional and national context, characterised by above-average levels of income and homeownership. Solihull is in the midst of dynamic and rapid socio-demographic change. In contrast to Birmingham's young population, Solihull has an ageing population,between 1996 and 2016 the population aged 65 and over increased by 40%.

NHS Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group will take a phased approach to the project. Phase one will be a small cohort of practices who have been identified, patient population for will be between 50,000 -80,000.
