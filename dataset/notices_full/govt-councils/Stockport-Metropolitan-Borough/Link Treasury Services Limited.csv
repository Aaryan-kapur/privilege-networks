The Council does not currently have a contract for such services, having subscribed in the past to various market information systems as were appropriate for the management of a large in house equities portfolio, as part of the Council's Pension Fund. The in-house portfolio has now been pooled in accordance with Central Government requirements and these subscriptions are no longer cost effective and so the decision has been approved to procure a professional Treasury Management Advisor.

It should be noted that, apart from MS Excel, the Council currently uses no bespoke Treasury Management systems. In total, approximately 0.7 FTE staff are employed on Treasury Management activity by the Council.
