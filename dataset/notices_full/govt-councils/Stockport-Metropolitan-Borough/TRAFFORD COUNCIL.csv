This tender presents providers with an opportunity to support the Children, Families and Wellbeing (CFW) Directorate with the provision of independent travel training to young people and vulnerable adults with Special Educational Needs and disability (SEND). Young people and vulnerable adults with learning disabilities may need extra help or support because of a range of needs, such as understanding, physical or sensory, emotional or behavioural difficulties or difficulties with speech and language. Those who will typically be offered independent travel training will be considered to have 'Moderate Learning Difficulties'. They may or may not receive their education in a Special School.  The aim of an Independent Travel Training Service is to work with young people/vulnerable adults, parents, carers, schools and colleges to develop the ability of young people/vulnerable adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to travel independently to school or college.
The service will enable the trainee to plan a journey, work out timetables and learn how to use public transport, helping them to stay safe now and in the future, allowing them to access work and job opportunities as well as increased access to social and leisure activities. A travel trainer may work with more than one trainee during the programme. However, the training should always be delivered on a one-to-one basis to ensure that the young person/adult is receiving the full attention of the trainer and that they are acting independently.",,,"North West","80500000 ","James Hunter",james.hunter@star-procurement.gov.uk,"1st Floor","Trafford Town Hall",Stretford,"M32 0TH",UK,"+44 1619122572",http://www.trafford.gov.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=dd6b3ecb-0a24-e611-8114-000c29c9ba21 ",,01/08/2016,31/07/2018,08/07/2016,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,210000,210000,20/08/2016,210000,"[Manchester Travel Training Partnership|M20 2XA|NONE||Yes|No]","Mr Kevin Northrop",01/09/2016,31/07/2018,"Open ",

They provide legal protection for vulnerable people who are, or may become, deprived of their liberty when placed or residing in a hospital or care home. DoLS require a 'managing authority' ( ie relevant hospital or care home) to seek authorisation from a 'supervisory body', in this case Trafford Council, to be able to deprive someone lawfully of their liberty. The safeguards apply to people aged 18 or over in England and Wales who have a 'mental disorder' and lack the capacity to consent to care or treatment in a hospital or care home where this may be necessary to prevent them from harm and appears to be in their best interests. The process involves a number of assessments undertaken by a Best Interests Assessor ( a Social Worker with specific training) and a doctor approved under Section 12 of the Mental Health Act 1983 with appropriate DoLS training ( or a registered medical practitioner who meets specified criteria).

TRAF001-DN62837-00304455,Contract,"Trafford Council",Awarded,2018-06-01T14:35:41Z,"Working Well Expansion Programme","The expansion of Working Well is a central pillar of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority's (GMCA) devolution agreement with Central Government.  
  
The ambition of the devolution agreement is to achieve better outcomes for residents by securing significant influence, and ultimately control, over public spending in Greater Manchester (GM). The agreement was made on the condition that the GMCA will adopt a mayoral model of governance. The benefits of the agreement cover a range of thematic areas including investment funds; transport; business support; housing; and planning.  
  
The specific elements of the devolution agreement that are relevant to this tender exercise are:- 
a)    An expanded Working Well programme, ultimately supporting 50,000 people to progress towards employment. Building on the existing programme, Working Well will provide participants with integrated, intensive support.   
b)    A co-commissioned Work Programme. GM will commission, jointly with DWP, Work Programme provision that draws on and complements Working Well expansion, a reformed post 19 skills landscape and broader employment and skills reform.  
c)    A reshaped FE post 19 skills system. GM will incentivise skills providers to focus on meeting the needs of defined GM priority groups, ensuring the right support is in place to move people on to employment or to continue in education.  
d)    A reformed approach to delivering the AGE Grant. Ensuring the use of the grant is aligned with broader support for GM residents and the priority growth sectors across GM.  
e)    Alignment of Skills Capital. Ensuring GM has the infrastructure that supports the delivery of a reformed employment and skills landscape. 
  
In addition to supporting residents into employment, Working Well Expansion will support those in low paid or insecure employment to progress to higher skilled and higher paid jobs. Greater Manchester has low levels of productivity compared with London, and a key outcome of Working Well is to increase productivity levels and reduce dependency of those in work who continue to rely on benefits such as Working Tax Credits.   
  
The Working Well Expansion will consist of three separate elements: personalised support (which this tender pertains to); the Mental Health Therapeutic Interventions tender; and the Skills for Employment tender. It is envisaged that these elements will begin delivery at the same time and they will work together and integrate with other local services, to provide a holistic approach to moving people into sustainable employment. The personalised support is the linchpin of the Working Well Expansion programme and all clients will be supported through this service. 
  
Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council is acting as the procurer on behalf of the GMCA to appoint a provider/s. The programme will be delivered across all ten Local Authority areas of GM:

The programme in its whole is purposefully iterative in its development and commissioning, the aim of which is to put GM in a unique position to build a truly collaborative programme that shapes skills delivery and responds to skills needs that emerge throughout the 3 year programme. 
Skills provision is critical to GM's recovery from Covid19. This programme provides an opportunity to support businesses as they rapidly develop and innovate to maintain and create economic activity and jobs, with a focus on increased productivity through developing the skills of their workforce. The foundational and frontier growth sectors identified in GM's Prosperity Review and Local Industrial Strategy (LIS) will also be key priorities for this programme.
