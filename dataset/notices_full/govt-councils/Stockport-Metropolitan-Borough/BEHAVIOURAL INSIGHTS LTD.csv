The issues with low readership and comprehension of contractual terms and privacy notices
The fact that very few consumers read terms and conditions is well evidenced and widely acknowledged. Just 33% of consumers claim they usually read website terms; websites' server data suggest that only 1% actually do.1 Studies asking consumers about terms immediately after a purchase find only a third understand many of the basic terms.2
Evidence also shows that low levels of readership and comprehension expose consumers to detriment. One in ten consumers has experienced regret in the past 12 months for not reading the terms and conditions.3
Two thirds of all UK businesses sell directly to consumers and just over half of these businesses have had a dispute with their customers over their terms and conditions.4 One in ten businesses facing such a dispute needed to go to court to resolve it.
BEIS observes in practice and through conversations with businesses that many businesses aspire to communicate terms clearly. However, there is currently no clear evidence or guidance on what forms of presentation are effective. This study will provide a solid evidence base for 'role model' firms, and can be used to inform industry codes of practice and/or any potential future regulation.",,,London,"73200000 79300000 ",,Research@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House",,SWINDON,"SN2 1ET",England,"01793 867005",,,,,21/03/2018,31/05/2018,08/03/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,150000,,22/03/2018,149825,"[BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS LTD|4 Matthew Parker Street

Age-related stereotypes - sometimes negative, sometimes positive - abound and can affect people's attitudes and behaviour, but we do not have enough evidence directly linking stereotypes to hiring decisions, or very much evidence on promising approaches to overcoming age-bias and discrimination in the recruitment process.

For this Invitation to Tender we are interested in commissioning a research team to help build our understanding of the kinds of language and imagery commonly used in recruitment messaging (including job advertisements, job descriptions etc.) that might display or reinforce bias against older applicants.

This ITT follows on from our previous evidence work and is one of three projects we are commissioning in 2020 on the topic of reducing recruitment bias against older workers. The three projects are:

-Understanding and improving recruitment language, imagery and messaging (this ITT)
-Understanding the recruitment landscape and system in the context of older applicants
-Understanding the recruitment experience for older workers
We are happy for bidders to bid for multiple Invitations to Tender, but we will evaluate each bid based on its own individual merit.

Taken together, the three projects commissioned through these ITTs will feed into a broader two-year programme of work developing, testing and communicating new and improved recruitment approaches directly with employers and recruitment organisations. We plan to tender for this broader phase of work in the latter half of 2020. As such, the outputs from this piece of work should be geared towards directly supporting the developing, testing and communicating phase.",,,"Any region","73000000 ","Centre for Ageing Better",responses@ageing-better.org.uk,"45 Whitfield Street",,London,"W1T 4HD",England,,https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/,,"https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/itt-good-recruitment-older-workers-understanding-and-improving-recruitment-language ","Closing date 5pm on 25 February",09/03/2020,09/09/2020,25/02/2020,YES,"Understanding and improving recruitment language, imagery and messaging",Yes,Yes,No,Services,60000,60000,14/04/2020,59385,"[BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS LTD|4 Matthew Parker Street
