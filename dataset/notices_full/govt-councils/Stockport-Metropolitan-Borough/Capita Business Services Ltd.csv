The CL1 ordering period was extended in early 2016 until 18 June 2017 as permitted under the CL1 Framework. The CL1 Framework allows Capita Business Services Ltd to continue to provide services for a 12 month time frame beyond the ordering period. As a result, CCS has invoked this contractual provision to ensure public sector customers have continuity of service while the procurement for the replacement framework is underway, and CL1 will continue until June 2018. This will allow time to develop the new procurement vehicle to support customers to get the right workers, with the right skills with continued focus on value for money going forward.

for regulating consumer gas safety in GB and does this largely through the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974
and the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 (GSIUR).
A key component of the consumer gas safety regime is the Gas Safe Register, the official gas registration body
for the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Guernsey, appointed by the relevant Health and Safety Authority for
each area. By law, all gas engineers must be on the Gas Safe Register.
Gas Safe Register deals with all aspects of the downstream gas industry covered by the following regulations:
- Great Britain: The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998,
- Northern Ireland: The Gas Safety (Installation & Use) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2004.
The regulations cover both piped natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The gas registration scheme is owned by HSE and exists to protect the public from unsafe gas work.
The current service concession agreement will end on the 31 March 2019 and HSE is seeking to put in place
a new SCA to operate the Gas Safe Register for a 5-year period beginning 1 April 2019. The provider will be
required to undertake a number of tasks and, in doing so, protect and inform the public of the risks of unsafe
and illegal gas work, and of other dangers such as carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.",,,"Any region","76100000 ",,procurement@hse.gov.uk,"Redgrave Court","Merton Road",BOOTLE,L207HS,England,,,"GSR SCA - redacted version for publication - 11 June 2019.pdf ",,,01/04/2019,31/03/2024,31/03/2019,NO,,No,No,No,NotSpecified,1,,11/09/2018,0,"[Capita Business Services Ltd|71 Victoria Street

The framework also includes alternative technology platforms for managing the customers' recruitment processes.

ESPO will impose on economic operators requirements aimed at protecting the confidential nature of information made available throughout the procurement procedure (as permitted by Regulation 21(3)) and, before receiving that information, economic operators will be required to complete & return a Confidentiality Agreement, which will be available once economic operators have expressed an interest in the tender opportunity.

Lot 1: Managed Service Provision - Service provision where one Managed Service Provider takes responsibility for delivering recruitment services on behalf of the Customer, as an alternative to the Customer managing a framework of individual Agencies. Managed Services can often involve the Managed Service Provider operating a 'tiered' structure of Agencies to deliver the Services, dependent on the service model provided.

Lot 2: Vendor Management System - For Customers who are looking for a technology solution to help them manage recruitment Agencies, either on a self-service basis where recruitment is devolved to Hiring Managers, or via their own internal recruitment team. The system used will help Customers to manage their supply chain, and interact with Agencies & Temporary Agency Workers through the system in regards to ordering, timesheet reconciliation, compliance & management information

Lot 3: Talent Pool Technology - For Customers who are looking for a Talent Pool Technology Platform that they can contract with directly and either include within their existing MSP delivery model or develop as a stand-alone solution. A Talent Pool Technology Platform is an online database which allows a Worker to register, create, maintain & delete their own profile and be matched automatically to jobs put forward through the platform by Hiring Managers. The Talent Pool Technology Platform will be available via desktop and/or app. As such, Tenders will only be accepted for Lot 3 from Tenderers who fulfil the Talent Pool Technology Core Specification. Tenderers for Lot 3 Talent Pool Technology will own the intellectual property rights (IPR) and development of the platform.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period. An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

To tender: (a) Go to www.eastmidstenders.org, (b) Register (c) Search for tender opportunity '653F_19' d) Express an interest (e) Download the tender from the website.

Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: http://www.espo.org/About-us-%281%29/FAQs/Legal 

The below information is applicable to all three lots: ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself. 

Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.
