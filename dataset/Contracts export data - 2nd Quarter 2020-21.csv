Should these fail we have had mobile hydraulic units to deploy to prevent tidal water reaching Bristol. These devices have recently failed and cannot be used. We therefore no longer have the capability to save Bristol should our gates malfunction. We therefore urgently need to upgrade and have a new capstan fitted for this purpose. We have contacted Bristol Port Authority who put us in touch with North Sea Winches a company used by them for a similar purpose. This took 2 months to get a site visit and quotation which we are very satisfied with. My concern is that if we now ask for 2 additional quotes the city will remain vulnerable should our gates fail. The sum of £46k will be insignificant to the billions of pounds the flood or collapse of the Harbour will cause.
